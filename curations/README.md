# Group curations

Curation – which we might define as the assembly of co-related materials to tell a story, make an argument, or build a collection – forms an important pillar of the geospatial humanities. All mapping is necessarily a form of curating: as historians, geographers, and mapmakers, we selectively choose what kinds of information to display within our final products.

This semester, you will take turns wearing your curator hat.

* A document in `pdf` or `docx` format, answering all the questions that are tagged with ![q], and which are summarized in the [activity deliverables](#activity-deliverables) section

# Introduction and context

This activity will prompt you to think about how digital archives – the fodder for lots of humanistic geospatial research – are constructed. In general, you will:

* Reflect on your own search/query habits and refine them into more intentional techniques
* Learn common sources for geospatial data related to archives
* Understand the basic motivations behind counting people (e.g., censuses)

# Archives

In his essay on [the "stuff" of archives](https://read.dukeupress.edu/radical-history-review/article-abstract/2014/120/94/73309/The-Stuff-of-ArchivesMess-Migration-and-Queer), Martin Manalansan observes at least three functions (2013:94) of an archive:
1. *A repository or storage of information and documents*. This might be the most familiar definition, and one that will be familiar. They are typically organized by **provenance**, the "[fundamental principle of archiving](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/provenance.html)," which refers to the individual, family, or organization that created or received the items in a collection.
2. *A legitimizing instrument of power structures and prevailing authorities.* Archives don't merely document the ["order of things"](https://monoskop.org/images/a/a2/Foucault_Michel_The_Order_of_Things_1994.pdf), as Michel Foucault called it, but actually affect how things are ordered (often in the [interests of colonization](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02435632)).
3. *A quotidian site for marginalized subjects as well as gendered and erotically charged energies, meanings, and other bodily processes.* The bulk of Manalansan's essay deals with this queer and feminist function of archives, which accounts for those everyday archives of our own making: the pile of unwashed laundry in the corner of your room, the expired food at the back of your fridge, even the strata of garbage in your trash can. 

In what ways do these functions of archives – which overlap with one another - translate in digital terms?

## Digital archives

In an essay reflecting on digital archives, Jake Hodder and David Beckingham (2022:1300-1301) argue that the search tools we use today are not simply venues for looking at digital (and digitized) materials, but that they structure how you *search* and even inform how you *think*.

Read the excerpt below:

> If you have used a digital archive – or platforms like Google Books or JSTOR – you will be familiar with the search box that invites us to enter our ‘key terms’. It has the look and feel of a finding aid that we might use to identify a call number in a physical archive. But, as Ted Underwood (2014) argues, the underlying technology and philosophical principles are vastly different. The search bar does not help us navigate the arrangement of the archive; it allows us to circumvent it. Digital platforms privilege searching over browsing, and that searching has more in common with data mining than document retrieval. The more precise the phrasing, the more efficiently digital search can personalise our results. This is part of the nature of computer search or ‘information retrieval – it is very effective at identifying exact terms and can do so across millions of data points in seconds.
>
> When we receive our search results, fragments of historical information are recombined from multiple collections and places with little fidelity to original order or provenance. As Sassoon (cited in Sternfeld, 2011:565) notes, digital archives return results as ‘a databank of orphans which have been removed from their transactional origins and evidence of authorial intent’. Digital archives, then, offer us an unprecedented means to quickly find exactly what we were already looking for. But rarely do we know what we are looking for, even when we think we do. And even more rarely do we know the precise, historical wording that would find it. So, we search by trial and error. We enter a term as a proxy for a broader theme. We refine it. We search again. If we are lucky, we might be able to tie our research question to a distinct and historically stable watchword that reveals dozens of new sources.

This process of **recombination**, as Hodder and Beckingham call it, yields an entirely new kind of archive. When you're doing any kind of research on/with the internet, but especially historically focused research, you position yourself within and in between these hybrid archives of new and old.

Through recombination, you'll come across a variety of sources, which can mostly be sorted into two categories: **primary** and **secondary**. Per [this Tufts research guide](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/c.php?g=249007&p=1658227), they can be distinguished as such:

- *Primary sources* include artifacts, documents, recordings, newspaper articles, or other sources of information that were created at the time under study.
- *Secondary sources* cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources (although the distinction between primary and secondary is not hard and fast).

When you search through these "digital archives," how do you do it? Where do you go? What kinds of terms do you use? What kinds of sources are you seeking?

Here are a few tips for searching these often unruly digital archives.

## Parsing the unruly

1. **Develop search terms for keywords and subjects.** A set of foundational keywords and terms should guide any search you do. They should be firm enough to define your research topic, but flexible enough to transfer across different search databases. Depending on the database, you might want to search by [subject heading or keyword](https://guides.smu.edu/c.php?g=814523&p=6157516):

   |                  | Keywords                                                                                  | Subjects                                                                                                                  |
   | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | *Definition*       | natural language words describing your topic - good to start with                         | pre-defined "controlled vocabulary" words used to describe the content of each item (book, journal article) in a database |
   | *Flexibility*      | more flexible to search by - can combine together in many ways                            | less flexible to search by - need to know the exact controlled vocabulary term                                            |
   | *Search Scope*     | database looks for keywords anywhere in the record - not necessarily connected together   | database looks for subjects only in the subject heading or descriptor field, where the most relevant words appear         |
   | *Result Precision* | may yield too many or too few results                                                     | may yield many irrelevant results                                                                                         |
   | *Refinement*       | if too many results - also uses subheadings to focus on one aspect of the broader subject | results usually very relevant to the topic                                                                                |


   See below for a few example topics, using the [simple template provided by Tufts' Hirsh Library](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/ld.php?content_id=9921496). How would you fill in the rows?

   |                             | Rise of the Peloponnesian League | Geography of John Smiths | Reconstructing ancient climate data | Gender and the Salem witch trials |
   | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | *Subjects* | ???                              | ???                      | ???                                 | ???                               |
   | *Keywords*                    | ???                              | ???                      | ???                                 | ???                               |

2. **Use search operators.** Search operators help constrain and specify your search terms. For example, if you're researching the [Peloponnesian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_League), but not necessarily the Peloponnesian *War*, you could construct a search phrase that excludes results focused on the War itself. In another case, you might be researching a person whose name is [quite common across history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith), and need to add qualifying terms to your search; e.g., you don't want to include a ton of hits for [John Smith (explorer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(explorer)) during your research into [John Smith (abolitionist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(abolitionist)). See the table below – adapted from this guide from [Hirsh Library](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/hsl-advanced-searching) – for a description of each kind of search operator.

   | Operator   | Description | Example |
   | ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | *Wildcard*          | A character is used within or at the end of the word to substitute for one character or no characters. | `colo?r` retrieves documents with the words `color` and `colour`.                                 |
   | *Truncator*        | Retrieves any number of characters (including no characters) after the word stem.  | `witch$` retrieves documents with the word `witch`, as well as `witchcraft`, `witchy`, etc. |
   | *Boolean Operators* | Retrieves searches by combining terms with the use of words `AND`, `NOT`, and `OR`. Use `OR` to gather synonyms, use `NOT` to eliminate, & use `AND` to require both (or all) factors. | `map OR atlas`, `peloponnesian NOT war`, `john smith AND abolitionist`. |
   | *Bound Phrase*      | Retrieves searches for an exact match of the text with the use of quotation marks around the terms. | `"sanborn atlas"` |

   > ![imp]
   > 
   > These search operators will not always be the same across all databases. For example, Google uses a [unique set of operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) for its search engine.

3. **Go beyond Google.** Google is a great starting point for research materials, but it won't always get you where you need to go. 
   1. *[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)* is a handy resource for querying scholarly resources, including out-of-copyright books digitized by [Google's massive digitization project](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/). I like drifting through Google Scholar with different combinations of subjects and keywords, 
   2. *Academic and public libraries* are great resources of archival materials. In addition to the libraries on Tufts' campus, you are within striking distance of dozens of magnificent public libraries with excellent historical collections in [Boston](https://archives.bpl.org/), [Cambridge](https://www.cambridgema.gov/historic/researchaids), [Somerville](https://www.somervillepubliclibrary.org/books-movies-music-etc/local-history-collection), [Medford](https://medfordlibrary.org/resources/local-history/), and more.
   3. *Digital libraries* provide ready-made access to digitized materials from all kinds of sources. [Digital Commonwealth](https://digitalcommonwealth.org) provides access to over 1 million materials including postcards, photographs, oral histories, maps, and more. Other examples include [California Digital Library](https://cdlib.org/) and [Kentucky Digital Library](https://kdl.kyvl.org/).
   4. *Specialized digital archives* (which, sure, you could argue that these are just another kind of digital library) give access to specific kinds of materials, particularly primary sources. [Fulton Search](https://www.nypl.org/research/collections/articles-databases/fulton-search-historical-newspapers) provides access to millions of scanned newspaper pages from the US & Canada, while [Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/) lets you search through over 120 million patent publications.
4. **Let yourself drift.** Use the resources above to [drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive) through these various digital libraries & archives. Embrace the possibility of a chance encounter: as Hodder and Beckingham say, "search by trial and error... enter a term as a proxy for a broader theme... refine it... search again. If we are lucky, we might be able to tie our research question to a distinct and historically stable watchword that reveals dozens of new sources."
5. **But don't get too distracted.** Speaking from experience, it's easy to be sucked into "the archive." The [philosopher Jacques Derrida](https://www.jstor.org/stable/465144) calls this impulse *archive fever.* He says we are "in need of archives," that we "have a compulsive, repetitive, and nostalgic desire for the archive, an irrepressible desire to return to the origin, a homesickness, a nostalgia for the return to the most archaic place of absolute commencement" (1996:91). But I digress!

    If you ever feel like you are losing track of your purpose, return to your foundational search terms. What brought you here in the first place?

Before moving on to the next section on geospatial archives, answer the questions below. Think of them as an exercise in preparation for this term's final project.

| ![q]                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Pick a humanistic question (e.g., a  topic) that you could answer using geospatial methods, and write it down here. (If you're stumped, think about the exercises we've completed so far. [If you're *totally* stumped, just use one of the example topics listed above.]) |
| 2. Develop a set of **subjects** and **search terms** that would help you search for this topic. Search, refine, and search again. Write the subjects and search terms here.  |
| 3. In a few sentences (3 should suffice), summarize what you found about your chosen topic, including where you searched and at least one compelling primary source. |

# Geospatial archives

## The Domesday Book

What is a "geospatial archive?" What are primary and secondary geospatial sources, and where can you find them?

To answer this question, it's useful to go back to one of the earliest sources of geospatial data that remains easily accessible today: William the Conqueror's *[Domesday Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book)*, a survey of England and parts of Wales undertaken in C.E. 1086.

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, King William the Conqueror sent his agents "to measure and catalogue the realm he had won" (Rogers 2015:50). [Dallas Rogers](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781783483334/The-Geopolitics-of-Real-Estate-Reconfiguring-Property-Capital-and-Rights) calls the survey a "mediating technology" that allowed the King to establish and enforce a land taxation system. It's not that different from other tools, like urban tax atlases or modern GIS databases for real estate, which ultimately serve the administrative purpose of collecting tax.

|*The Domesday Book from 1086 (top); an urban atlas from 1898 (middle); and the City of Boston's modern tax parcel viewer in ArcGIS Online (bottom).*|

The Domesday Book is an example of an extremely well-preserved census, or an official count of population. In the U.S., we use censuses to tabulate demographic data as well as determine political representation in the House of Representatives.

The [OpenDomesday project](https://opendomesday.org/) has not only made the original manuscript domesday folios available for free online, but they've also mapped them and in doing so produced a really excellent historical gazetteer. Pretty neat.

## Modern geospatial archives

In a sense, any modern spatial data object – that is, any `geojson` or `shp` file – is both a primary and seconday source. They derive from some sort of primordial source document – a map, plan, image, or census – but they also serve as the primary source for any spatial data that derives from them.

Take, for example, this spatial data of [Boston's historic shoreline](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkircu2ol). Lacking a time machine, the makers of this data did not go out and survey the historic shoreline themselves, but they weren’t just making educated guesses to produce their map, either: they created it by digitally tracing, among other objects, Osgood Carleton’s [1796 plan of Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8530). In turn, you could use it to make something like this [digital map of additions to Boston’s shoreline between 1795 and 1995](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n4326).

While there is no overarching, canonical system for geospatial data archiving, there are all sorts of spatial data libraries that you can use to search and retrieve geospatial data. We typically call these **data portals** or **data clearinghouses**.

Here are a few general-purpose portals:
1. Tufts GeoData Portal: https://geodata.tufts.edu/
2. BTAA GeoPortal: https://geo.btaa.org/
3. Harvard Geospatial Library: https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/harvard-geospatial-library
4. MassGIS: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-layers

And here are more that focus specifically on censuses:
1. The Great Britain Historical GIS: http://www.gbhgis.org
2. The China Historical GIS: http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis
3. Chinese Civilization in Time and Space: http://ccts.ascc.net
4. Taiwan History and Culture in Time and Space: http://thcts.ascc.net
5.  The Belgian Historical GIS: http://www.hisgis.be
6.  The Historical GIS for the Netherlands: http://nlgis.dans.knaw.nl

If you can't find anything, in 1-2 sentences, consider how you would go about composing your own spatial dataset to answer this topic. Where would you start? |

# Mapping two censuses

Now, let's crack open ArcGIS and dive into two examples of mapping censuses. One is focused on China and the other on the U.S. 

## China Historical GIS

Tufts GIS has collected lots of useful spatial datasets collected on the `M: Drive`. One of them contains historic population data for China, going back to 1953. Follow these steps to get the necessary data into your project.

1. Either in your Box account or your `H: drive`, make a workspace for this week's activity.
2. In that workspace, create a new ArcGIS Pro project.
3. Open your project file.
4. Open the **Catalog** pane and navigate to `M:` ➡️ `Country` ➡️ `China` ➡️ `ChinaDataCenter` ➡️ `ChinaHistoricalCountyCensus` ➡️ `1953`
5. Add the two shapefiles, `china53` and `prov53` to the project.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 1964 data.
7. Download the Admin 0 `countries` data from Natural Earth: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/
8. Move the data from your `downloads` folder and into a sensible location in your workspace.
9. Add the `countries` data to your project.

Once you have the data in your project, organize it:
1. If the layers `World Topographic Map` and `Hillshade` are turned on, turn them off.
3. Give each layer a sensible name. Here's what I'll use:
   1. `china53` ➡️ `Counties 1953`
   2. `prov53` ➡️ `Provinces 1953`
   3. `china64` ➡️ `Counties 1964`
   4. `prov64` ➡️ `Provinces 1964`
   5. `countries` ➡️ `Countries`
4. In your **Contents** pane, drag and drop each layer so that they appear in this order:
   1. `Provinces 1953`
   2. `Counties 1953`
   3. `Provinces 1964`
   4. `Counties 1964`
   5. `Countries`
5. **Group** your 1953 provinces and counties together by selecting both of the 1953 layers ➡️ Right-click ➡️ "Group"

    ![group](images/image004.png)
6. Finally, symbolize the `Countries` layer to be unintrusive, so that it clearly scans as a background (remember figure-ground?). I recommend gray or tan, with boundaries of `0.5` width in the same color as the fill, but darker.

Now symbolize the `Counties 1953` layer by its symbology, following these parameters:
1. Graduated colors
2. Field = `A53002`
3. Sensible color ramp
4. 

South China Sea and disputed paracel island territories get associated with Guangdong in the data.

Silently, the data makes a geopolitical claim – one that Vietnam would not, I imagine, be happy to see.

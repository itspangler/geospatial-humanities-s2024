# Week 02: Distortion

>*Flattening the earth to your advantage*

How do we go about displaying round earth as a flat map? What are the basic mathematical and geodetic rules associated with this process? What sacrifices do we have to make in order to "flatten" the globe, and how have those sacrifices been used strategically?

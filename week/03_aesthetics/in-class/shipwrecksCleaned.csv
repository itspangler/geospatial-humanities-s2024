steamship of Glasgow, owned by Ellerman Lines. It was
built by W. Gray Co. Ltd. of West Hartlepool in 1921 and
was propelled by four steam turbine engines, giving it a
maximum speed of 13.5 knots. On the day it was sunk,
the vessel was en route from London to Cape Town and
Bombay, under the command of Herbert Percival, and
carrying 183 crew, 167 passengers and 3,000 tons of
general cargo. It was one of 27 vessels in convoy OB-
216, being escorted by one escort ship, one sloop, three
corvettes and one destroyer. At approximately 2.00am on
21 September the vessel was attacked and sunk by U-138,
commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang Lüth. Two
passengers, including a 17-year-old boy, and one crew
member were killed by the explosion when the torpedo hit
the stern. The remaining crew and passengers abandoned
the crippled vessel. Of those, 318 were picked up by the
SS Guinean and later transferred to the destroyer HMS
Vanquisher, while a Belgian trawler rescued 17 crew and
12 passengers. The badly damaged City of Simla sank a
day later. In all, four ships from convoy OB-216 were sunk
by U-138 off the coast of Donegal over a two-day period,
including the Boka (eight dead), the New Sevilla (two dead)
and the Empire Adventure (21 dead).

The wreck of the City of Simla was located in 1969 by
Risdon Beazley Marine Ltd., and was to be found lying
upside-down on the seabed with its stern blown off. The

It was built in Pembroke Dock, Wales, in May 1917, weighed 4,290 tons and was capable of 29 knots. It was commissioned on 18 February 1918 and saw service during the final months of World War I. It was refitted as an anti-aircraft cruiser in late 1939 and employed as an escort vessel for transatlantic convoys. It was during one such voyage that the Curacoa, under the command of Captain John W. Boutwood, was accidentally lost while escorting the Cunard White Star liner RMS Queen Mary. The famous liner was part of a convoy of 27 vessels that was en route from New York to the Clyde and was carrying 15,000 American troops, headed for service with the Allied war effort in Europe. As the convoy was nearing the northern approaches to Ireland, the liner was steaming at 28 knots on an evasive zigzag course when it accidentally collided with the Curacoa, striking the cruiser on its port side and splitting the smaller naval vessel in two. The Curacoa sank within minutes, with the lost of 338 of the 364 crew on board. The RMS Queen Mary received relatively minor damage and continued on her way, without stopping to pick up any survivors from the Curacoa for fear of attack from U-boats. It was leftto other vessels in the convoy to eventually rescue the remaining 26 survivors, who included the Captain among their number.

Following the rescue, the same destroyers released depth charges, forcing U-110 to surface. The 43 submariners

Justicia (SS),W07410,Steamship,"Malin Head, Co. Donegal, 38km NW of",19/07/1918,55.66305,-7.72031,GSI,"This 32,234-ton steel steamship was originally built by Harland & Wolff for the Holland-Amerika Line as the
Statendam, a liner capable of carrying 3,430 passengers. It was powered by triple-expansion engines, allowing for speeds up to 18 knots. The Statendam was launched on 9 July 1914 and was due to serve on transatlantic passenger service routes, but the British Government requisitioned the vessel and changed its name to Justicia, earmarking it for service as a troopship in 1917. Under the management of the White Star Line, the Justicia entered service on 7 April 1917 and made several successful transatlantic trips, carrying American troops for service in Europe. The Justicia had a close call when it survived a U-boat attack in January 1918, when it had 600–700 crew on board, but no passengers. Later that year, on 19 July, the liner was en route from Liverpool to New York in convoy when it was attacked by UB-64, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Otto von Schrader. At 2.30pm a torpedo struck the engine room, and at 4.30pm two more torpedoes were fired: one missed its target; the other was diverted by gunfire. At 8.00pm a fourth torpedo was discharged, but gunfire again proved successful in diverting the aim. Naval escorts dropped depth charges that damaged the UB-64’s fuel tanks, forcing the U-boat to retreat from further attack. The next morning UB-124, on its first patrol, sighted the Justicia under tow, accompanied by a dozen escort destroyers. At 9.15am UB-124 launched two torpedoes at the damaged vessel. Eventually, the Justicia sank, stern first, at 12.40pm, with the loss of 16 lives; the rest of the crew were rescued by nearby ships. The naval destroyers HMS Marne, Millbrook and Pigeon subsequently succeeded in sinking UB-124. 

On the seafloor
The wreck of the Justicia measures 224m in length, 50m in width and 8m in maximum height, with an average height of 3.1m. The vessel is orientated N–S on the seafloor and shows some sediment scouring on the east side. Today, even 70m down, the ravages of the relentless Atlantic swell and corrosion have left this gigantic ship in a very broken state. She is still an impressive sight, however, and her majestic bow, still largely intact, is probably one of the most remarkable sights a diver can encounter in Irish waters. The starboard anchor, still in its hawse, dwarfs any visiting diver and epitomises the scale of this great ship. Gigantic capstans and windlasses dot the fo’c’sle, and aft past the giant forehold the bridge superstructure has collapsed down and to port, to rest with deck level on the seabed. Giant rectangular windows, each the size of a door, gaze sternly out over the foredeck. Behind that again lies the field of 12 giant Scotch boilers, each the size of a modern semi-detached house, followed by the two enormous eight-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engines. Just aft is the steam turbine, which was run by the exhaust steam from the two engines and drove the centre propeller shaft and which is often overlooked amongst the giant structures. This three-screw arrangement was pioneered by Harland & Wolff on the Laurentic, the wreck of which lies nearby, and also on the Titanic and her sister ships. The stern is fairly broken up now, but the stern gun and rudder quadrant are still visible.","BMS 1914-18, 178; BVLS 1914-18, 93; Bishop 2002, 51–6; Bishop 2004, 27–34; Bishop & Louden–Brown 2001, 8–14; Brady et. al. 2012, 115-8; Grant 1964, 113–14; Hocking 1989, 366; Lloyd’s List, No. 32, 469, Thur. 25th Jul. 1918, 6; Lloyd’s List, No. 32, 470, Fri. 26th Jul. 1918, 6; Lloyd’s List, No. 32, 537, Mon. 14th Oct. 1918, 7; Lloyd’s List, No. 32, 617, Fri. 17th Jan. 1919, 8; Williams 1997, 80–81",1918

It weighed 314 tons surfaced, measured 44m long and could carry a crew of 25 men. It was capable of 12.7 knots on the surface, propelled by 700 horsepower engines, and had a range of 3,200 miles if travelling on the surface. The Type IID submarine could reach a maximum depth of 100m and carried six torpedoes. It was built by Deutsche Werke in Kiel, launched in 1940 and became operational in 1941. It does not appear to have seen much action during World War II, spending much of the time as a training boat, although it did sink a Soviet submarine (M-99) while on patrol at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland. It surrendered at the end of the war, in early May 1945, and was brought to Loch Ryan from Wilhelmshaven for disposal as part of Operation Deadlight. While being towed to the disposal site, the towline for U-149 parted in bad weather and the U-boat was sunk by gunfire instead. The wreck of U-149 measures 20m in length, 4.5m in width and 3.3m in maximum height, with an average height of 0.6m. The submarine is orientated NW–SE on the seafloor.

It weighed 761 tons on the surface, measured 67m long and could carry a crew of up to 44 men. It was capable of 17 knots on the surface, powered by 2,800–3,200 horsepower engines, and had a range of 6,500 nautical miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. It could reach a maximum depth of 200m and could carry both mines and torpedoes. It was built by Schichau of Danzig, launched in March 1943 and was commissioned into service in May of the same year. It initially carried out equipment tests in the Baltic Sea in August 1943 before entering full service. It was commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Helmut Kandzior and carried out two patrols during its service, but neither sank nor damaged any vessel during its war career. The first patrol was off Norway, from June to August 1944, where it unsuccessfully engaged a Liberator aircraft of the 86th Squadron. The submarine’s second patrol was to the west of the Hebrides, in August 1944, where it is now known to have been lost off the north coast of Donegal some time in the last days of September. The exact cause of loss is unknown, but all 50 crew on board were presumed dead. In July 2001 the wreck of U-743 was identified by divers of the Operation Deadlight Expedition, led by Innes McCartney. The wreck of the U-743 measures 58m in length, 7.5m in width and 4.7m in maximum height, with an average height of 2.1m. The submarine is orientated NE–SW on the seafloor. In contrast to most of the other U-boat wrecks in the area, this Type VII was a war loss. The wreck is essentially intact, but the attack periscope has been bent right over, with the lens buried in the seabed, and the schnorchel has been broken off at the height of the conning tower, with its base still upright and located in its collar on the conning tower. The fact that all hatches on the wreck are closed would suggest that it was schorcheling when it was sunk, possibly due to a collision with an unknown vessel.","Brady et. al. 2012, 151; Miller 2000, 27; Möller & Brack 2004, 73; Rossler 1981, 54–5; Wynn 1997, Vol. ii, 145; www.uboat.net",

It was built at Bremer Vulkan in Vegesack, Germany, and was commissioned into service on 27 February 1943, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Heinz von Davidson. U-281 carried out four patrols during its service and was involved in a number of engagements in the North Atlantic. During one such engagement, in October 1943, it shot down a Royal Canadian Air Force Sunderland southwest of Iceland. Three crew of U-281 were wounded during this encounter. The submarine spent much of 1944 patrolling off Britain and Ireland, but failed to sink any vessels. At the end of hostilities U-281 surrendered at Kristiansand, Norway, in May 1945 and was brought to Loch Ryan in Scotland. The submarine was due to be scuttled as part of Operation Deadlight and the Polish destroyer Blyskawica towed it out into open water. It never reached its destination, however, as 30km northwest of Malin Head it sank. It now lies in 67m of water.

In 2001 the wreck was identified by divers during the Operation Deadlight Expedition, led by Innes McCartney. It measures 41m in length, 7m in width and 3.1m in maximum height, with an average height of 0.7m. The submarine is orientated NNE–SSW on the seafloor, is in poor condition and lies on its port side. The bow tubes have been dragged off to one side, with all four still held together in the bow bracket, and now the forward end of the pressure hull marks the beginning of the main wreck. A schnorchel with anti-radar covering and air radar warning dipole is folded on the deck. The conning tower hatch is shut, while the bow torpedo loading hatch is open, allowing the interior of the torpedo room to be inspected. GSI Wreck No_76.

U-2511,W10128,Submarine,"Malin Head, Co. Donegal, 26km NW of",7/1/46,55.57922,-7.62607,GSI Wreck Data,"U-2511 was the first Type XXI German submarine to make an operational patrol in the last days of the war. This vessel represented a new high-speed ‘electro boat’, weighing 1,621 tons and carrying a crew of 57. It was not only faster underwater and quieter than other U-boats, it could also outrun many naval escorts while still submerged. The Type XXI possessed an integral Schnorchel, which allowed it to stay underwater as long as food and fuel were available, making its detection very difficult for the Allies. However, most submarines of this type failed to emerge from training or from shipyards, with only this single example attaining operational status before the war ended. Its torpedo tubes were fitted with a hydraulic loading system, which allowed for a complete reloading in about 20 minutes, rather than the several hours it took for other U-boats. This new submarine type was capable of 15.6–17.6 knots, had two 2,200 horsepower engines and a range of 11,150 nautical miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. It could reach a maximum depth of around 280m and carried up to 23 torpedoes, or alternatively 14 torpedoes and 12 mines. It was built by Blohm & Voss, Hamburg, launched in September 1944 and commissioned into service in the same month. The innovative U-2511 was under the command of Korvettenkapitän Adalbert Schnee (September 1944–May 1945), a U-boat ace who had previously sunk 23 ships, including the Nils Gorthon, which was lost off Malin Head. The U-2511 departed Germany in mid-March 1945 for Norway, to carry out deep-water trials in the Oslo-Fjord. On 30 April it set out from Bergen on its first mission, intending to patrol the Caribbean, but the ceasefire was called en route, just one day into its journey. A few hours later, on the return trip to Norway, the submarine encountered a British naval group, including the cruiser HMS Norfolk. The U-boat approached to within 500m of the British warship without any sonar contact from the enemy destroyer. Schnee had the opportunity to make an absolutely deadly attack against the cruiser, but as a ceasefire had been called he desisted from doing so. Instead, he returned the submarine to Bergen and surrendered it on 9 May. On 14 June, as part of Operation Deadlight, U-2511 was transferred to Lisahally in Northern Ireland. It was subsequently sunk using gunfire after its tow cable broke on 7 January 1946, 26km NW of Malin Head.
In 2001 the wreck site was identified by divers during the Operation Deadlight Expedition, led by Innes McCartney. The U-2511 lies on its port side and is relatively intact, measuring 65m in length, 10m in width and 5.6m in maximum height, with an average height of 2.4m. It is orientated N–S on the seafloor and shows sediment scouring on her east side. The stem is missing and all six of the torpedo tubes can be seen. Aft, the massive conning tower rises up over the wreck. While the forward flak turret was still in place when the wreck was first discovered, it has now joined the aft turret on the seabed. The sky periscope is slightly extended and the optics are visible. Aft of the conning tower the wreck is essentially intact all the way to the stern, where the aft hydroplanes and a single rudder can be seen. As the U-2511 was sunk by gunfire, shell damage is visible in many areas. One of the biggest holes is in her starboard side, alongside the conning tower, and a mass of cabling and batteries is visible along the keel section of the wreck.

It weighed 1,120 tons surfaced, measured 76m long and could carry a crew of 48 men. It was capable of 18.3 knots surfaced, had 4,400 horsepower engines and a range of 11,400 miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. The Type IXC U-boat could reach a maximum depth of 230m and carried up to 22 torpedoes. It was built by A.G. Weser of Bremen, launched on 12 May 1941and commissioned into service on 23 August 1941. In the submarine’s four-year career it was responsible for sinking 26 ships: 20 of these were destroyed while operating in the western Atlantic, and a further three ships were targeted off Portugal and Morocco during 1942. U-155 survived the war and surrendered in May 1945 at Wilhelmshaven. It was transferred to Loch Ryan, Scotland, on 21 June 1945 and was designated to be scuttled, along with 115 other U-boats, off the northwest coast of Ireland as part of Operation Deadlight. The submarine failed to reach the designated site and was sunk on 21 December 1945, 25km northwest of Malin Head. In 2001 the wreck was identified by divers during the Operation Deadlight Expedition, led by Innes McCartney. The wreck of the U-155 measures 52m in length, 5.5m in width and 4.3m in maximum height, with an average height of 3.9m. The wreck lies upright and is orientated NW–SE on the seafloor. Scouring has occurred along the northeast side of the vessel. This Type IXC U-boat sits upright on the seabed. The forward hydroplanes and torpedo tubes have fallen off to one side, revealing the front of the pressure hull. The outer cladding hull is in good condition and the ‘beamy’ shape of the Type IXC is very evident.

It had two decks, one funnel, four masts and triple expansion engines. The liner was capable of reaching 13.5 knots and operated on the transatlantic passenger service between Glasgow and Canada. It was originally built as a cargo ship, but was converted to a liner in 1905. The Athenia was considered to be one of the first proper ‘cabin’ liners on the transatlantic trade, having accommodation for 50 first-class, 200 second-class and 1,000 third-class passengers. At the time of its loss the liner was en route from Montreal to Glasgow, carrying 7,000 tons of general cargo, including empty shell cases, 440 horses, 109 passengers and 44 military personnel. Without warning, the Athenia was torpedoed by U-53, which was patrolling the waters off the north Donegal coast under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose. The U-53 had already sunk 50 ships since 1916; it would sink 98 ships in total during the war years. The liner did not sink immediately, which enabled most of the crew and passengers to safely board the lifeboats. Two lifeboats made it to Inishtrahull Island, with some of the crew being saved by destroyers responding to Athenia’s SOS call. Sadly, however, 15 lives were lost during the attack. The U-53 continued to wreak carnage in the area over the coming days, sinking six more vessels, including the Roscommon, the Devonian, the Boniface and the Kenmore, with the lost of eight more lives and over 36,000 tons of shipping. The wreck of the Athenia was located by the salvage company Risdon Beazley Marine Ltd. in 1970 and was partially salvaged in 1975, with the recovery of 109 tons of brass.

On the seafloor
The wreck of the Athenia is orientated WNW–ESE on the seafloor. It is mostly buried, with the main protrusion from the seafloor being amidships. It measures 148m in length and has a maximum width of 43m. In 1974 the wreck stood 15m proud of the seabed, but in 2011 it had a maximum height of 10.6m, with an average height of 2.5m. The Athenia is another wreck that has been heavily salvaged, but in spite of this, it remains one of the most scenic wrecks in this depth range. The bow, now somewhat skeletal around the gunwales, but all the more picturesque for that, lies on its starboard side and the sand-polished brass letters ‘ATH’ of the vessel’s name are visible on the seabed nearby. Aft the forehold has been torn open to get at the cargo of empty shell cases, many of which still lie strewn around on the seabed. Amidships the port side of the hull has toppled over onto the boilers, forming the highest point of the wreck, and aft further salvage work leads to the rudder quadrant and the defensive stern gun.","Brady et. al. 2012, 77-78; Bonsor 1979, Vol. iii, 344–5; GSI Wreck Data; Halkett 2006, 148; Hocking 1969, 56; Larn & Larn 2002; UKHO Wreck Data 1996; Williams 1997, 60; www.uboat.net",1917

Empire Heritage (SS),W09623,Steamship,"Malin Head, 28km NW of",8/9/44,55.54263,-7.71728,GSI Wreck Data,"The Empire Heritage was built by Armstrong, Whitworth and Co. in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne for the Kerguelen Sealing & Whaling Co. of Capetown, South Africa. It originally operated as a whaler called the Tafelberg and weighed 13,640 tons. After hitting a mine and running ashore in the Bristol Channel in 1941, it was declared a total loss and rebuilt as a tanker for the Ministry of War Transport. The newly renamed Empire Heritage weighed 15,702 tons and was capable of 11 knots. It was re-launched in February 1943 and operated by Christian Salvesen & Co., Edinburgh. The vessel was part of a convoy (HXF-305) of nearly 100 ships, en route from New York to Liverpool and the Clyde, when it was torpedoed and sunk 28km northwest of Malin Head. The tanker was under the command of Captain James Campbell Jamieson and had on board a cargo of military tanks, vehicles, 16,000 tons of fuel, 88 crew and 73 passengers. The submarine that destroyed it, U-482, had been patrolling the northwest approaches since 16 August and had already sunk the tanker Jacksonville, HMS Hurst Castle and SS Fjordheim by the time it encountered the Empire Heritage and convoy HXF-305. In the early hours of 8 September, U-482, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hartmut Graf von Matuschka, fired a number of torpedoes at the convoy, successfully hitting the Empire Heritage on its starboard side abaft the bridge. Within ten minutes the tanker had capsized and sunk, with the loss of 113 crew and passengers. The Pinto, a convoy rescue ship, was sunk shortly afterwards by the same submarine as it attempted to rescue survivors from the Empire Heritage. The survivors of both ships were picked up by HMS Northern Wave and landed at Derry.
On the seafloor
In her prime the Empire Heritage was an eye-catching ship, but not necessarily the most graceful. Despite this, her wreck is an extraordinary sight. It is orientated NW–SE on the seafloor and covers an area 155m long by 37m wide and has a maximum height of 6.9m. The entire ship has collapsed down and across to starboard, leaving the bulk of the deck and its cargo sitting on the seafloor. Towering over this scene are the 1.5m-girth, 20m-high midships derricks, though these are looking increasingly unstable as the years progress. Scattered around to starboard are the remains of the vessel’s cargo that makes this dive unique: the deck cargo of Sherman tanks and 20-ton trucks, seemingly in any position except upright, bar one solitary tank. There is nothing remotely like this extraordinary sight anywhere else in Europe. Aft past the six gigantic Scotch boilers the stern is almost inverted, with a huge propeller dominating the scene and a 4-inch gun lying off to one side.","Brady et. al. 2012,  146-9;Bishop 2002, 50–56; Hocking 1969, 217; Larn & Larn 2002; UKHO Wreck Data; Wynn 1997, Vol. I, 317; www.uboat.net",1944

It weighed 761 tons surfaced, measured 67m long and could carry a crew of up to 44 men. It was capable of 17 knots on the surface, had 2,800–3,200 horsepower engines and a range of 6,500 nautical miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. It could reach a maximum depth of 200m and carried both mines and torpedoes. It was built by Kriegsmarine- Werft, Wilhelmshaven, was launched in May 1944 and commissioned into service on 7 July 1944. The submarine carried out one patrol off the Scottish coast under the command of Kapitänleutnant Ralf Jürs, but failed to sink any ships. It was surrendered at Bergen, in Norway, in May1945. It was transferred to Loch Ryan, Scotland, where it was to be scuttled along with 115 other U-boats off the northwest coast of Ireland as part of Operation Deadlight. However, U-778 accidentally sank while under tow to the dump site on 4 December 1945, approximately 18km northwest of Malin Head. The wreck of U-778 was identified by divers during the Operation Deadlight Expedition in 2001. The U-778 is one of the most intact U-boats that can be dived in Irish waters. It measures 54m in length, 5m in width and 4m in maximum height, with an average height of 2.4m. The U-boat is orientated NW–SE on the seafloor, with the distinctive long, narrow shape of a submarine visible on the multibeam sonar. Unusually, the conning tower retains its cladding and the bow is undamaged. The schnorchel can be found folded down on the deck.

It weighed 759 tons surfaced, measured 67m long and could carry a crew of up to 44 men. It was capable of 17 knots on the surface, had 2,800–3,200 horsepower engines and a range of 6,500 miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. It could reach a maximum depth of 250m and carried up to 39 mines and 14 torpedoes. It was built by Blohm & Voss, Hamburg, launched in January 1944 and commissioned into service on 10 February 1944. This submarine was under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Klaus Hilgendorf for most of its service. It operated in British waters in January 1945 and was involved in an engagement with a patrol boat and a destroyer, but failed to sink either. It was also involved in weather-reporting duties during this period. No vessels were sunk or damaged by this U-boat. U-1009 survived the war intact and surrendered itself in Loch Eriboll, Scotland, on 10 May 1945, where it was designated to be scuttled, along with 115 other surrendered U-boats, off the northwest coast of Ireland as part of Operation Deadlight. On 5 January 1946 the submarine was deliberately sunk using gunfire after its tow cable broke 29km north of Tory Island. On the seafloor The wreck of U-1009 measures 46m in length, 6m in width and 1.7m in maximum height, with an average height of 1m. The submarine is orientated N–S on the seafloor. The multibeam sonar image shows the wreck to be partly buried and/or broken up. The conning tower and the forward end of the pressure hull are peppered with shellholes. The majority of the superstructure has come away, as have the bow tubes, and the top section of the schnorchel now lies on the seabed. The wreck was surveyed by the Geological Survey of Ireland in 2004 as part of the Irish National Seabed Survey. GSI Wreck No_171.

It had two 2,200 horsepower engines and a range of 11,150 nautical miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. It could reach a maximum depth of around 280m and carried up to 23 torpedoes, or alternatively 14 torpedoes and 12 mines, and was manned by a crew of 57 men. It was built by Blohm & Voss, Hamburg, launched in August 1944 and commissioned into service in the same month. This submarine was under the command of Kapitänleutnant Horst von Schroeter (August 1944–May 1945), who earlier in the war had sunk seven vessels, most notably an enemy submarine, the HMS P-615, off the coast of Sierra Leone in April 1943. The U-2506 departed Germany for Bergen, Norway, during the last days of the war, but never carried out war patrols. This submarine was faster than any previous U-boat and possessed an integral Schnorchel, which allowed it to stay submerged as long as food and fuel allowed. Clearly representing a significant development in submarine design and technology, the Type XXI submarine had much better facilities for its crew, was quieter and couldremain underwater for the greater part of a mission. On 14 June 1945, as part of Operation Deadlight, U-2506 was transferred to Lisahally, Northern Ireland, and was sunk on 5 January 1946. The wreck of U-2506 measures 62m in length, 5m in width and 6.2m in maximum height, with an average height of 3.4m. The submarine is orientated ENE–WSW on the seafloor. In contrast to the extensively damaged U-2511, this Type XXI is essentially undamaged and is a truly magnificent sight for submarine afficionados. When first discovered, the conning tower together with the fore and aft flak positions were completely intact, but now the flak positions have either fallen or are in the process of falling off onto the seabed and a lot of the external cladding is missing. The 20mm gun barrels on both turrets are still in place, however. The only other real damage apparent is that the rudder has fallen off. Forward, the Balkongerat hydrophone array, a further development of that found on the U-1271, is clearly visible. GSI Wreck No_101.

The vessel was built by the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast in 1900. It was propelled by an 847 horsepower, three cylinder, triple-expansion engine, making it capable of attaining 14 knots in speed. It had a crew of 203 and carried up to 135 first-class passengers, serving the Liverpool–Boston route. The Devonian is probably best known for the role it played in the rescue of passengers of the passenger line Volturno, which caught fire and sank in the mid-Atlantic in October 1913, with the loss of 134 of the 654 passengers and crew on board. The Devonian was one of ten vessels that came to the Volturno’s assistance, saving 59 passengers and crew. Following the outbreak of hostilities, the Devonian was lightly armed with a single 4.7-inch stern gun, but that offered little protection in the face of U-boat attack. On 21 August 1917, while in a westward-bound convoy and carrying only two passengers, she was torpedoed by U-53, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose. One lifeboat was destroyed in the explosion, but the remaining eight were lowered, allowing most of the crew to escape the sinking vessel. She sank 44km northeast of Tory Island, due north of Bloody Foreland, Co. Donegal, with the loss of two crew and 500 tons of general cargo. The survivors were rescued by a tug and trawler and taken to  Lough Swilly, where they were landed safely at Buncrana, Co. Donegal. The wreck of the Devonian measures 170m in length, 28m in width and 6.1m in maximum height, with an average height of 1.9m.  GSI Wreck No._90.

U-218,W10125,Submarine,"13km NNW of Malin Head, Co. Donegal",4/12/45,55.49957,-7.43245,GSI Wreck Data,"U-218 was one of six Type VIID German submarines commissioned and the only one of its type to survive the war. It weighed 965 tons surfaced, measured 77m long and could carry a crew of up to 44 men. It was capable of 16 knots on the surface, had 2,800–3,200 horsepower engines and a range of 8,100 nautical miles if travelling on the surface at 12 knots. It could reach a maximum depth of 200m and could carry up to 15 mines and 14 torpedoes. It was built by F.G. Krupp Germania Werft AG in Kiel, launched in December 1941 and commissioned into service in January 1942. Commanders of the vessel at different stages in its career were Kapitänleutnant Richard Becker and Kapitänleutnant Rupprecht Stock. U-218 spent most of its service operating in the Atlantic and had a number of lucky escapes, sustaining serious damage on several occasions. In October 1942, U-218 was ordered to Gibraltar to attack the Allied Forces invading North Africa, but the submarine was forced to return to its naval base at Brest after being damaged by depth charges from HMS Wrestler. On 2 August 1943 U-218 narrowly escaped destruction after it was attacked while searching in the Bay of Biscay for survivors from the destroyed U-383. A Wellington aircraft from Squadron 547/B attacked the U-boat, causing some damage and injuring six crew. Depth charges dropped by the Wellington failed to sink U-218, but did force it to return to base for repairs. The submarine had a small number of successes, damaging a convoy ship with torpedoes in August 1942. In September 1943, after laying 12 mines in the Caribbean, U-218 sank a sailing freighter off Trinidad. In 1944 U-218 laid mines in the English Channel, causing damage to SS Empire Halberd and sinking a 352-ton minesweeper trawler, the Kurd. In April 1945 one of its mines sank the fishing trawler Ethel Crawford west of Ailsa Craig, while it was operating off Scotland. By the time the war had ended, U-218 had sunk three ships and damaged two others. It surrendered at Bergen, Norway, on 8 May 1945. From there it was transferred to Loch Ryan in Scotland, to be scuttled as part of Operation Deadlight. On 4 December 1945, while being towed out by HMS Southdown, it sank 13km NNW of Malin Head.

The wreck of U-218 was identified by divers during the Operation Deadlight Expedition in 2001. The wreck sits on the seabed, with a 45-degree list to port. Apart from minor damage to the bow and stern, and the loss of the conning tower cladding, it is completely intact. The five-chute mine section behind the conning tower is reminiscent of a modern ballistic missile submarine and the huge chutes, running all the way through the depth of the hull, are easily big enough for a diver to swim through. The wreck measures 65m in length, 7m in width and 3.9m in maximum height, with an average height of 2.2m. The submarine is orientated NNW–SSE on the seafloor. Sediment scouring has occurred around the vessel.","Brady et. al. 2012, 154; Miller 2000, 27; Möller & Brack 2004, 94; Rossler 1981, 54–5; Wynn 1997, Vol. i, 15; www.periscopepublishing.com",1945

The Carthaginian was a 4,444-ton steel steamship owned by the Allan Line Steamship Co. Ltd. of Govan, Glasgow. The vessel was built in 1884 by Govan Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. It was propelled by a 475 horsepower, compound steam engine and capable of attaining 14 knots in speed. The Carthaginian had a crew of 57, under the command of Captain A. Ogilvie, and could carry 596 passengers in three classes. Before the outbreak of hostilities in 1914 the vessel plied various transatlantic routes, typically out of Glasgow. She was subsequently armed with a 4-inch stern gun. On 14 June 1917, while on a voyage from the Clyde to Montreal with general cargo, she struck a mine 2.5 miles northwest of Inishtrahull, Co. Donegal, laid by U-79 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Otto Rohrbeck. She sank, with the loss of 32 lives; the survivors were picked up by a British naval vessel and brought ashore at Buncrana, Co. Donegal. The Carthaginian was one of 22 ships sunk by U-79 during 11 patrols. The HMT Corientes and HMT Charles Astie were also mined just north of Malin Head in June 1917 by the same U-boat. The U-79 survived the war, surrendering to the French on 21 November 1918. It was subsequently used by the French Navy until 1935. 

The wreck of the Carthaginian is orientated NNW–SSE on the seabed and measures 116m in length, 21m in width and 4.3m in maximum height, with an average height of 2.1m. Although it is well broken up, there is still plenty to see on this wreck. The defensive stern gun can be found beside the rudder quadrant, along with the boilers and engine amidships. The bow is fairly upright, though it is now raked aft as the structure behind has collapsed, and the anchor derrick still stands on the fo’c’sle deck.

Empress of Britain (SS),W07307,Liner,"Bloody Foreland, 90km WNW",28/10/1940,55.31766,-9.6827,GSI_1,"At 42,348 tons, this passenger liner was the largest vessel of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company fleet and was the largest merchant vessel lost during World War II. It was built by John Brown & Co., Glasgow, in 1931 at a phenomenal cost of $15,000,000 and was considered to be one of the most luxurious vessels of its time. It embarked on its first world cruise in 1933 and could travel up to a speed of 24 knots, with accommodation for 423 first-class passengers, 260 tourist-class passengers and 470 third-class
passengers. With the commencement of hostilities in 1939, the liner was requisitioned as a troop transport and it made several voyages for that purpose. Under the command of Charles Havard Sapsworth,
the Empress of Britain was on a circuitous voyage from Cape Town via the Suez Canal to Canada and then on to Liverpool when on 26 October 1940, as it was travelling 150 miles off the coast of Ireland, it was attacked by a German long-range Focke-Wulf 200 Condor airplane. The liner was attacked three times and quickly caught fire, killing a number of people on board. The ship did not sink immediately, which enabled most of the 419 crew and 224 military personnel and families to safely board the lifeboats. The survivors were picked up by Royal Navy escorts. The Empress of Britain was then taken in tow by a Polish 
destroyer, the Burza, and later assisted by Royal Navy tugs  Marauder and Thames. Two days later, approximately 90km WNW of Bloody Foreland, Kapitänleutnant Hans Jenisch in U-32 torpedoed the Empress of Britain twice, causing it to sink in nine minutes. In total, 49 people were lost during the attacks. Two days later, U-32 was itself sunk by the destroyer HMS Harvester.

The wreck of the Empress of Britain measures 212m in length, 40m in width and 23.1m in maximum height, with an average height of 7.1m. The vessel is orientated E–W and lies upside-down on the flat seabed.","Brady et. al. 2012, 137-139; Hocking 1989, 222; Larn & Larn 2002; Lloyd's List 39, 304, Monday 28th October 1940; Lloyd's List 39, 305, Tuesday 29th October 1940; Lloyd's List 39, 309, Saturday 2nd November 1940; Lloyd's List 39, 317, Tuesday 12th November 1940; Smith 1947, 83; Williams 1997, 113-14; www.thegreatoceanliners.com.",1940

At the beginning of the war, the liner was hired by the White Star Line and converted into an armed merchant cruiser. The steamship was en route from Liverpool to Halifax via Buncrana in County Donegal, from where it departed on 25th January 1917, but struck a mine and sank with the loss of 354 lives. Many of the bodies were recovered and were buried in St Mura’s graveyard in Fahan where a memorial was erected to them in 1919. The ship was carrying a cargo of gold for the British Treasury, which was to be used to purchase arms, munitions and vital supplies for the war effort. 3,186 of the 3,211 gold bars on board were recovered during subsequent salvage operations following its sinking. What remains of the wreck measures 140m in length by 25m in breath and lies at an average depth off the seabed of c. 5m. The RV Keary surveyed the wreck in 2014. The postcard above shows a painting of the Laurentic under steam prior to the beginning of the war (Ian Lawler Collection). The wreck now lies at an average depth of c. 37m in a slight scour and is partially buried, with collapsed structure and a significant debris field surrounding it. Multibeam images of the wreck by INFOMAR clearly shows four of the six boilers are still in-situ; however, two have been dislodged and have been rolled out to the starboard side of the wreck by the Atlantic swells. The wreck surveyed in 2008 as part of the JIBS seabed mapping programme. Wreck measures 162m long, 19m in maximum width and lies in 30m of water. GSI Wreck No_307.

La Trinidad Valencera,W07691,Galleon,"Mossy Glen, Kinnagoe Bay, Inishowen Peninsula",16/09/1588,55.26124,-7.00764,National Monuments Service,"The fourth largest of the ships that made up the Spanish Armada, this requisitioned Venetian merchantman of 1,100 tons was lost in Kinnagoe Bay off the northern tip of the Inishowen Peninsula in September 1588. The wreck lies in shallow water approximately 100m offshore on the western extent of Kinnagoe Bay. Two rivers, Glenagivney River and the Long Glen River, flush fresh water into the Bay area through deep gullies that run down the slopes, one through the locally known Black Glen into Glenagivney Bay (almost centrally placed within Kinnagoe Bay) and the other into the area known as Kinnagoe Port, within the north-western limits of the Bay. The seabed here is soft sand with rock outcrops and the white strand of the southern limits of Kinnagoe act as an interface between land and sea. Discovered in 1971 by City of Derry Sub Aqua Club, through the identification of one of La Trinidad Valencera’s great siege guns, a bronze cannon de batir with the inscription of  ‘PHILIPPUS REX’ and the inscription of its maker, the royal gunfounder IOANES. M?RICUS A,. LARA. FIERI. CURAVIT / OPUS. REMIGY. DE. HALUT / ANNO 1556. This allowed a positive identification to be made for the wreck being that of La Trinidad. Over the next 15 years the members of the dive club assisted underwater archaeologist Dr Colin Martin and his wife Paula Martin in the excavation of the wreck. The results of this work has been widely published by Dr Martin, indicating that not only is the wreck itself significant but the wealth of artefactual material recovered both from the site itself and extensive and significant artefactual finds make La Trinidad Valencera the richest of the Armada wrecks discovered to date. In 2004 following reports from Inishowen Sub Aqua Club that more material was exposed on the seabed at the site, the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the National Monuments Service carried out detailed survey and limited excavation at the site of what was believed to be an iron cannon. This resulted in the identification of a previously unrecorded broken up gun carriage, several siege carriage wheels and limbers and smaller artefacts including Iberian wares. The main body of artefactual material recovered by Dr Martin is housed in the Tower Museum in Derry, while a large, ornate siege cannon is also on display in the National Museum of Ireland.","Atherton 2013; Fallon 1978; Flanagan, L., 1988; Kelleher 2011, 123-129; Martin 1975; Martin 1979, 12-38; Martin 1989, 61-69; Martin 1994, 207-17; Mattingly 1959",1588

Carinthia,W07205,Liner,"Tory Island, Co Donegal / Bloody Foreland, offshore 43 miles W",7/6/40,55.24751,-9.29971,GSI Wreck Data,"The Carinthia, formerly known as the Servia, was a 20,277-ton steel steamship owned by the Cunard White 
Star Line and built in 1925 by Vickers Armstrong, of Barrow-in-Furness. It was propelled by eight-cylinder, 
triple-expansion steam turbines capable of attaining 18 knots in speed and could carry 1,650 passengers in three classes. She was one of a class of five ships built for Cunard to operate on transatlantic routes, the others being the Scythia, Samaria, Laconia and Franconia. During the 1930s the Carinthia was also engaged in cruising. When the hostilities broke out in September 1939, the vessel was commissioned as an armed merchant crusier, equipped with eight 6-inch and two 3-inch deck guns, under the command of Captain J.F.B. Barrett. On 7 June 1940, while on patrol on the western approaches, she was torpedoed by U-46 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Engelbert Endrass. The stricken vessel remained afloat long enough to allow the evacuation of the crew, except for two officers and two ratings who were killed in the initial attack. She was towed by escorting vessels for Glasgow, but eventually sank off the coast of Donegal.

The wreck of the Carinthia measures 169m in length, 38m in width and 10m in maximum height, with an average height of 7.6m. It is orientated roughly E–W. For the observant diver, patches of grey paint on the side of the hull would suggest the wreck is fairly recent, rather than 70 years old, and on that basis might be expected to be fairly intact. However, the whole ship has concertinaed over to starboard and collapsed down, deck upon deck, so that the wreckage sits only 8m high in its entirety. All of the glass in the portholes on the port side of the vessel is smashed, which suggests that it was depth-charged and this, combined with the ravages of the Atlantic swells, might account for her devastated condition. The end result of this collapse is that the deck has a list of about 35 degrees. Her bow is twisted off somewhat and her forward bow area and the 6-inch guns have slewed to point aft. Most of the mid-ships upper decks are gone, leaving a clean ‘deck’ area across the ship, around and aft of what was the bridge area. Further aft, as the wreck drops to the stern area, a huge dark void can be seen like a ‘window’ inside the hull, and even the strongest diver’s torch cannot make out any decks inside this void, which means most of them must have collapsed internally. It presents an eerie, uninviting darkness in 112m of sea water. The port side of her stern stands up well, to about 10m, whereas the starboard side is level with the seabed. GSI Wreck No_131

The wreck lies c. 120m NE of Rutland Island in 3m-5m of water at low water Spring tides. 1620-1640s.  Local divers, including Liam Miller who reported the find, discovered the wreck in 2008. Subsequent Archaeological investigations on the wreck site from 2010-2013 by the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) of the National Monuments Service, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht recovered a significant quantity of artefactual finds, including munitions, pottery, leather, barrel material and a bandolier’s belt. The archaeological excavation focused on the internal limits of the wreck itself and revealed that the lower hold of the ship is preserved in situ from bow to stern, with a small section of orlop deck remaining along with a large section of transom and its rudder assemblage. The wreck itself was not removed but remains preserved in situ for future scientific investigation. The excavation was supported by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the wreck surveyed by the RV Keery in 2011. GSI Wreck No_299.

The wreck is heavily eroded as it lies within a dynamic environment with strong tidal currents and is subject to impact from heavy sea conditions. It is located in shallow water, c. 7m at low Spring tides. Local divers, including Liam Miller who reported the find, discovered the wreck in 2007. Subsequent Archaeological investigations on the wreck site from 2010-2011 by the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) of the National Monuments Service, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht identified that the remains consist of just the very lower, highly abraded hull timbers of the wreck, with all super structure eroded away. The known extent of the remaining hull runs for c. 25m having an NE-SW orientation. Scattered about the place were cupreous pins, bolts and copper nails. To the SW of the in situ hull is located a disarticulated section of heavily eroded keel with protruding keel pins, nails and remains of lead stripping use to keep wads of caulking in place. Pottery with a use period spanning the 18th-19th centuries was recovered along with the eroded centre coak of a wooden sheaf used within a rigging block.  The identity of the wreck remains unknown but records for a number of 18th-century and 19th-century ships lost in the general area may indicate that it could be one of them.  These include two French vessels involved in the 1798 Rebellion (WIID W07663 & W07331); a trading vessel Traveller of 1819 (W07689); the Alex Maxwell (W07112) and Samuel (W07593) both lost in the year 1821; the Andrew Nugent (W07121) lost in 1839 or the Forest Monarch (W06733) lost in 1848.",Kelleher 2018,

The guns are medium sized cannon and by the shape of the cascable, its button and the trunnions a date to the 18th century is probable, though such guns could also have continued in use into the early-19th century.

One of the merchant vessels commandeered by Philip II for his Levantine Squadron when preparing for his planned invasion of England in 1588. Built in Mataro near Barcelona for the Pilau family in 1570. Originally called the Santa María Santiago y Santa Clara. Plied the trade route between Spain and Sicily for most its career but was commandeered 4 times, serving at Lepanto in 1571, Lisbon 1580, Terceira in the Azores 1583 and finally with the Armada in 1588. While sheltering off  Inishmurray off the Sligo coast with two other vessels, La Lavia and the Santa María de Visón, they were caught in a storm on September 21st, dragged their anchors and were driven onto the beach at Streedagh with the loss of over 1000 lives.  An account of the wrecking event and his subsequent adventures in Ireland was written by Capt. Francisco de Cuellar who was on board La Lavia. In 1985 a group of English sports divers recovered three cannon from the site. A large demi-cannon, rudder with nine pintails and five gun-carriage wheels were also identified at the time but were not recovered. In April 2015, following major storms off the west coast in 2014 and 2015, which washed up significant pieces of wreckage at Streedagh, including a rudder, the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the National Monuments Service undertook a survey at the wreck sites in the course of which La Juliana was re-located.  Nine cannon (a mixture of Italian, Sicilian and Turkish guns) one carriage wheel, a cauldron and some smaller artefacts were recovered over a 4 week period in June and July of that year, including the large field gun left behind in 1985. Six of the Italian guns bear the date of manufacture, 1570, while 7 of guns carry depictions of saints. In all nine carriage wheels and two anchors were recorded as well as structural elements of the ship which had iron shot of various sizes and pottery adhering to them.

She was one of the vessels commandeered by Philip II for his Levantine Squadron when preparing for his planned invasion of England in1588 and was also the vice flagship of the squadron, under the command of judge Advocate-General, Martin de Aranda. While sheltering off Inishmurray off the Sligo coast with two other vessels, La Juliana and the Santa María de Visón, they were caught in a storm on September 21st, dragged their anchors and were driven onto the beach at Streedagh with the loss of over 1000 lives.  An account of the wrecking event and his subsequent adventures in Ireland was written by Capt. Francisco de Cuellar who was on board La Lavia. In 1987 a group of English sports divers recovered a small breach-loading swivel gun, identified as a falcon pedrero, from the site which bore the arms of the Labia family of Venice, the original owners of the vessel, thereby confirming the wrecks identity as la Lavia Beneciana (the Lavia of Venice). The foliate decoration and detail similar to other Venetian guns suggest that it was from the foundry of the Alberghetti family. Two wooden gun carriages complete with bronze guns were also identified at La Lavia site in 1987 but were not recovered. The Lavia acted as a hospital ship carrying medical supplies and instruments and for that reason the wreck site has the potential to contain some unique artefacts connected with medical practice of the time. The recovered cannon is now in the National Museum of Ireland.

Mayo",Between 1/1/1630 and 31/12/1699,54.26614,-9.92803,National Monuments Service,"In 2007 the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) of the National Monuments Service received a report regarding the discovery of two previously unrecorded cannon on the seabed in Broadhaven Bay, Co. Mayo. A two-day dive and metal detection survey carried out by the UAU in August 2009 identified 6 iron cannon at the site. The UAU returned to the site in 2010, 2011 (Excavations 2011, No. 456) and 2012 to carry out further survey work to map the known extent of the wreck site. A small-scale rescue excavation was also carried out in 2011 and 2012 to try and ascertain the date and identity of the wreck and to retrieve artefacts in danger of being lost or washed away. The site is located at the north-eastern end of the Mullet peninsula on the west side of Broadhaven Bay at the entrance to Blind Harbour in approximately 4-8m of water.
To date, the underwater survey and excavation has resulted in the discovery of twelve iron cannon, a spread of concreted cannon balls, eight boat-shaped lead ingots, pewter bottle tops, bricks, two wooden barrels and a number of smaller artefacts. No structural remains of the ship have been discovered thus far. The heavily concreted cannon lie scattered and dispersed over a 40m stretch of the seabed in an apparently haphazard layout on the seabed. Some small-scale excavation and detailed survey work was carried out around some of the cannon in an attempt to record their form, calibre and to establish if any distinguishing marks or diagnostic features were present. All twelve cannon are cast iron muzzle-loaders varying in length from 2-2.48m. However, most of the guns are of similar size, being in or around 2.2m in length which indicates that they are likely to be small-medium sized guns, possibly ranging from minion to saker if English in origin, or 3 to 8 pounder if they are of the Dutch continental system. One of the guns may be a finbanker – a type of gun cast in Sweden mainly for the Dutch market, and the largest guns appears to be a 12-pounder gun measuring 2.48m long. Initial analysis of the cannon indicates that they are likely date to the mid-to late 17th century. Eight boat-shaped lead ingots were also found during the course of the survey (see entry in Excavations 2011). The presence of the ingots, the pewter bottle tops and other artefactual evidence all point towards the wreck being that of a mid-17th-Century Dutch East Indiaman. The discovery of such a wreck in Irish waters is a unique find and there is a strong possibility that the records of the Dutch East India Company may contain the entire story of the ship and its loss. Further research and investigation is planned for 2013 to further determine the nature, extent and, if possible, the true identity of this wreck and to assist in the formulation of a definitive long-term management strategy for the site.",National Monuments Service.,1699

Between 1656 and 1663 the Zeepaard made two successful return trips from Wielingen, Holand to Batavia (Jakarta), Indonesia. On 28 October 1665 the Zeepaard set forth again for Batavia along with three other Dutch East Indiamen including the Gouden Leeuw, the Wittem Leeuw and the Zwarte Leeuw. The other three VOC ships safely made their destination in the Far East but the Zeepaard was not as fortunate and was reported as being wrecked west of Shetland in November 1665 along with its 150 crew. Recent dive survey work and historical research has confirmed that Zeepaard was not lost off the Shetlands but was wrecked in Broadhaven Bay, Co. Mayo. The location of the wreck was known about since 1969 but its identification was open to much speculation because it is located at the supposed site of a Spanish Armada wreck. The wreck site has been dived a number of time since the 1960s by various groups who were looking for the location of an armada wreck which is reputedly lost at the same location. In 1969 Sydney Wignall dived a wreck in Broadhaven Bay locating boat-shaped lead ingots, Dutch clay pipes (dating to c. 1675) and cast iron cannons (Wignall 1982, 76). The site was first reported to the National Museum of Ireland (NMI) in 1979 by Crochur O’Ceileachair, a radio officer from Belmullet who recovered a number of artefacts including which were handed over to the NMI. In 1986 members of the Leinster Divers Subaqua Club led by Leslie Lawrence began searching location and located a number of Iron cannon, boat shaped lead ingots and bellarmine Jars. In the following years up until 1991, the Leinster Divers carried out further survey work at the site accompanied by Nessa O’Connor of the National Museum of Ireland.

Creteboom,W06704,Tug,"River Moy, Ballina, Co Mayo",22/09/1937,54.13551,-9.13846,National Monuments Service,"During WWI iron was needed for the massive munitions production and became in scarce supply. The loss of over 6,000 steel-built ships and submarines along with their cargoes (approx. 14,000,000 ton) put further pressures on limited wartime steel resources and concrete was seen as a potential alternative given that it was in ready supply. Towards the end of World War I, production began on several fleets of concrete ships - of the 154 ships and 24 tugboats ordered by the British Admiralty, only 44 ships and 12 tugboats were completed and none of them ready in time to see action during the war. Three of these vessels eventually ended up in Ireland and are still to be seen today in various states of preservation. Two of these now form part of the Carlingford marina complex in Carlingford Lough. The Cretefield (18587) was a barge built in 1919 by T.J. Thompson of Warrenpoint and the Cretegaff (18588) was a steam-towing tug built 1920 in Shoreham by J. Ver Mehr. The third vessel, the Creteboom, lies in a wrecked state in the River Moy, Co. Mayo.

The Creteboom was a 267-ton steam-powered tug built from ferroconcrete, a concrete reinforced with steel bars). The 38m long vessel was completed in July 1920. The Admiralty had originally planned to use its fleet of ferroconcrete tugs and barges to transport iron ore from Spain to England but once the war ended that ore was no longer needed. In 1922 the Admiralty sold the Creteboom along with 48 other concrete vessels to Stelp & Leighton Ltd., who started the newly formed Crete Shipping Company. The tugs and barges initially plied the North Sea and Baltic, towing coal to the Continent. The Company went out of business in 1924. After being out of service for a number of years the Creteboom was sold to the South Stockton Shipbreaking Company in 1935 and stripped of all its fittings, boilers, engine and equipment.
In 1937 the vessel was sold to the Ballina Harbour Commissioners as a derelict vessel. The Commissioners planned to sink it to form a ‘groyne’ to keep the navigation channel clear at the mouth of the river. However, as the Creteboom was being towed into position, it collided with another vessel and was damaged below the waterline. Efforts to keep it afloat failed and the concrete tug drifted and sank mid-channel where it stayed for 30 years. The tug was re-floated during the mid-1970’s by the OPW and moved a short distance away from the channel to its present position alongside Belleek Woods, where it helps direct the flow of water along the main navigation channel. Today the Creteboom is a well-known local landmark and tourist attraction.

Lying only 90m away from the Creteboom is another less obvious wreck called the Floweret
WW06731), Lying side by side, the two wrecks graphically illustrate the difference in deterioration rates between a traditional 19th-century wooden sail boat and an experimental concrete boat. The skeletal remains of the wooden boat are barely visible and as a result less well known, whereas the remains of the Creteboom tower out of the river. They provide a tangible insight into WWI, experimental ship construction and the history of navigation on the Moy. Both wrecks can be seen by passing craft plying the waters of the River Moy and viewed from nearby Ballina Quay and Belleek Woods.

Unknown,W18584,Logboat,"River Boyne, Oldbridge. Approximately 300m upstream of the Drogheda M1 suspension bridge",Prehistoric,53.71856,-6.40177,National Monuments Service,"In June 2016 four anglers (Stephen Murphy, accompanied by Kieran Mahar, William Gregory and David Johnston) discovered the remains of a logboat while fishing a tidal stretch of the River Boyne at Oldbridge, Co. Meath. The logboat was found lying up-side-down mid-channel in the river approximately 300m upstream of the Drogheda M1 suspension bridge. Only the floor of the boat survives; it has an overall length of 3.12m,is parallel-sided in plan and has a maximum surviving width of 75cm. It is likely to be the case that the boat originally had a rounded bow and stern, flat longitudinal floor and slightly rounded transverse cross section. It it likely to have been at least 4m in length and very probably longer. There is no evidence for tool marks or other features on the boat. Both bark and sapwood are absent. Neither end of the boat survives intact but the bow is normally the narrower end of the vessel with logboats in Ireland. The floor is slightly rounded in transverse section and measures 12cm in thickness near the stern and is 9.5cm thick in the middle of the boat. The underside of the stern end of the boat is badly eroded and uneven as this side lay exposed on the riverbed and is marked with a number of circular hollows and depressions. These were probably caused by the scouring of riverine stones or pebbles on its surface whereas the opposite end or bow is smooth and rounded and appears to be the original under surface of the boat. Due to the fragility of the boat it was decided in collaboration with the National Museum of Ireland to recover the boat from the river for safe keeping. The boat is currently undergoing treatment by the NMI’s Conservation Unit. Recently a sample was sent to the 14Chrono Centre in Queen's University Belfast which provided a date of circa 3300BC-2900BC. This logboat is one of only 11 logboats known to have been found in the Boyne but more importantly it is one of only 7 other examples known from Ireland to date to the Neolithic period (c.4000 -2500 BC).",Brady 2016; Underwater Archaeology Unit Wreck Files,

Built in Seacombe in 1866, official no. 29,998. Classed A1 by Lloyd’s. Owned by John Banks Walmley of Liverpool, master was Edward Edgar. En route from Liverpool to Valparaiso, sixteen crew, general cargo. Encountered strong ESE gale, foggy conditions. Fog cleared, Balbriggan lighthouse seen c. 4 miles off starboard bow. Vessel began to drift ashore. Port, starboard anchors dropped to prevent drifting, but dragged. Struck ground 800 yards from shore. Drifted onto rocks off New Haven Point, c. 300 yards from high-water mark. Rockets fired by coastguard in an attempt to rescue crew. Crew appeared ignorant of the workings of the apparatus, made no effort to save themselves. Masts fell overboard, vessel began to break up rapidly. Crew thrown into the water, three were rescued. Two died soon after from exposure. Court inquiry was unable to arrive at any conclusion as to why the Belle Hill became wrecked. Cargo salvaged from wreck, including bar iron, gas pipes, pipes, kegs of paint, bales of bedsteads, 11 tonnes of iron. Wreck sold for £293 at auction. Locals salvaged some cargo. Seven bodies recovered and buried at old Balrothery cemetery, although local tradition states that some of the Belle Hill victims were buried in the cairn on the shore edge at Newhaven. Framing timbers of the vessel remained visible in the sand until the 1950s.","Bourke 1994, 12; Brady 2008, 143; Condrot et al. 1984, 52; de Courcy Ireland 1983, 93; Saunders Newsletters, 26th February 1875, London Times; Lloyd's List 18, 986, Sat.

It was owned by Dublin coal merchants Tedcastle, McCormick & Co. and had a compound expansion engine delivering 170 nominal horse-power. The Marlay, under the command of Captain J. Hamilton of Liverpool,
left Liverpool for Dublin at 2.00pm on Monday, 15 December 1902 with a 900-ton cargo of coal. After passing Holyhead, the Marlay’s progress was slowed by stormy weather and heavy seas. The ferocity of the storm increased as the Marlay neared the Irish coast and the crew were forced to man the pumps as the vessel began to take on water through leaking hatches. By 4.00am conditions had got so bad, Captain Hamilton gave the order to man the lifeboats as the vessel was listing to the starboard side. Able seaman Michael McGlue tried to lower the starboard lifeboat, but a huge wave smashed into the port side of the vessel, washing the starboard lifeboat overboard, with McGlue clinging grimly on to it. McGlue struggled to climb into the lifeboat, but was unable to get back to the Marlay because of the intensity of the storm. The Marlay sank within five minutes, with the loss of all 15 men remaining on board. McGlue was the sole survivor. He was picked up, still in the lifeboat, by passing steam trawler Peter Johnson near Rockabill at
10.15am and brought to Dublin. This tragic episode led to the foundation of a Widow and Orphans Fund to help the 11 wives who were left widowed and the 49 children who were left fatherless as a result of the loss of the Marlay.

The wreck of the Marlay, orientated NE–SW, measures 61m in length, 10.5m in width and 7.14m in maximum height. The vessel lies in a general sea depth of 27m, largely buried on the starboard side, with its bow pointing towards the SW. The hull of the Marlay is largely intact, though the superstructure has collapsed. Its cargo of coal lies scattered around the wreck.

One of the more significant ships lost in Dublin Bay, the Queen Victoria was a 337-ton, 150-foot-long paddle steamer built in Liverpool in 1837. It was owned by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company and was capable of 11 knots with 250 horse-power, diagonal compound engines. Under the command of Captain Church, the Queen Victoria departed Liverpool in fine weather on Monday, 14 February 1853, en route to Dublin with a general cargo, a voyage it had made numerous times without incident. On board the vessel were 24 crewmen, 12 cabin passengers, 75 deck passengers and one stewardess, totalling 112 persons. On approach to Dublin Bay the vessel encountered a snowstorm, which obscured the lights of both the Baily and Kish lighthouses. In spite of the poor visibility, the steamer failed to reduce its speed. It ran aground on the cliffs below the Baily Lighthouse, on Howth Head. At that point, about eight people were able to scramble ashore safely. The steamer then reversed away from the cliffs in an attempt to run the vessel ashore. This manoeuvre proved fatal, and the Queen Victoria began to sink rapidly. Confusion and panic ensued, as most of those aboard had been asleep below deck. Although there were four lifeboats on board, only the port lifeboat managed to launch successfully in the challenging conditions the crew were facing. The Queen Victoria sank slowly into the dark, cold waters, drowning most of those who remained aboard. The single lifeboat made it safely to shore with 17 rescued people, then returned to try to find any remaining survivors. By that stage, only the mastheads and funnel were visible above water, with survivors clinging desperately to the masts. The lifeboat managed to rescue five of these tenacious individuals, while the steamer Roscommon rescued the others. A further eight brave passengers were able to make it ashore by swimming. The Roscommon saved about 40 passengers in total. There are differing accounts as to how many on board were lost, suggesting that between 50 and 83 may have drowned, including Captain Church. The wreck was rediscovered by Marlin Sub Aqua Club in 1983 and has been surveyed by a number of Dublin dive clubs since then. It now lies in around 18m of water in an area of strong tides, 230m S of the Baily Lighthouse, and is orientated NW–SE on the seafloor. It measures 17.5m in length, 7.5m in width, with a maximum height of 3.4m. The remains of the vessel are largely broken up, with debris and remains of the paddle wheels and boiler clearly visible on the seabed. A number of artefacts have been recovered from the wreck site, and the ship’s figurehead is presently housed in the Maritime Museum in Dún Laoghaire, Co. Dublin. The Queen Victoria is one of less than a handful of paddle steamers that are diveable around the Irish coast.

Eltringham, South Shields in 1882, with 70 horse-power engines. It was owned by the Clyde Company (G. Kidston of Glasgow) and the ship’s master was J. Altrum. The vessel was en route, in ballast, from Dún Laoghaire to Dublin Bay in adverse weather conditions when it collided with a cattle steamship, the North Wall of Dublin, belonging to the London and North-Western Railway Company. The Flying Dart sank about 20 minutes after the accident, though the North Wall apparently sustained no damage. The six crew on board the tug were rescued by lifeboats despatched by the North Wall. The wreck of the Flying Dart measures 27.7m in length, 4m in width and is orientated E–W in a general depth of 28m. It is almost completely buried in the muddy, sandy seabed, the gunwale aft protruding only a few centimeters. However, amidships the boiler is clearly 
visible, with its central hole for the funnel, as are the remains of the paddle wheels to either side. As you move forward the hull is more exposed, leading to a small scour around the bow, which stands 1m high. The wreck lies directly under the route taken by the fast ferry, Jonathan Swift, on its way into and out of Dublin Port. It is therefore essential to check the ferry timetable as well as the tide tables before diving it.","Brady 2008, 200; Brady et. al. 2012, 37; de Courcy Ireland 1983, 113; GSI Wreck Data; Lloyd's List 16, 524 Wed.

The cargo ship was laid down in the yard of Akers Mekaniske Verksted of Oslo in 1939 and was launched, ready for fitting out, in 1940. However, following the German invasion of Norway in April of 1940, the ship lay alongside the quay wall at the Akers yard for the duration of the war. The Bolivar was finally completed in 1946, setting out on her maiden voyage, to South America, in December of that year. It was upon her return from Buenos Aires to Dublin via Liverpool in early March 1947, with a cargo of grain and bales of leather, that the diesel-powered vessel ran aground on the Kish 
Bank during a snow storm. Several attempts were made to take the vessel off the bank, but the wind direction and the falling tide both conspired to keep her stuck fast. As the tide continued to drop, the ship broke in two amidships, with the fore part of the vessel drifting clear and settling 100m away from the stern section. A Dublin-based tug, the Coliemore, and a Dún Laoghaire lifeboat, the Dun Leary 2, came to the Bolivar’s aid and successfully rescued the 39 crew and 12 passengers.Despite hopes of salvaging the stern section, both the ship and cargo became a total loss. The bow section remained largely intact and sank, while the after section was cut down to about the main deck line and was partially salvaged by the Hammond Lane Scrap Company in 1948.

The bow section initially remained largely intact and sank beneath the surface, while the after section was cut down to about the main deck line.

Curle & Company, with a nominal horse-power of 60. Benjamin R. Huntley of Hartlepool was one of the vessel’s owners. The ship’s master was Jacob Tolsen and under his command the Vesper left Glasgow on 11 January 1876, en route to Dunkirk in France, carrying 600 tonnes of coal and sugar. All was going well until the early hours of the morning of 13 January, when the vessel struck the Kish Bank and became stranded. Signals of distress fired by the stricken vessel were not responded to and after a number of unsuccessful attempts to get the steamer off the sandbank, the vessel began to break in two. After three failed attempts to launch the lifeboats, the ship’s captain and crew of 16 eventually managed to launch a
lifeboat and landed safely at Killiney, Co. Dublin. The captain blamed the sinking on a defective compass. A
subsequent inquiry held that Master Tolsen had failed to take the necessary precautions when approaching waters well known to be dangerous. Both Tolsen and his chief officer were severely reprimanded for altering the logbook in an effort to mislead the inquiry as to the ship’s correct position in relation to land. Master Tolsen was required to pay £5 towards the cost of the inquiry.

The wreck of the Vesper lies in a general sea depth of 8m and measures 54m in length, 9m in width and 2.27m in maximum height. The vessel lies on a sandy seabed, orientated N–S, with its stern to the N. The southern end of the wreck is mostly buried, but the outlines of the stern and of the boiler area are visible. The bow and focs’le area are the most prominent parts of the wreck and stand largely intact and proud of the seabed, with anchors and winches visible.

The sailing ship was en route from Liverpool to Sierra Leone, carrying a cargo that included 6,000 iron pots and iron hoops, when it was stranded and wrecked on the Kish Bank during a force 6 wind. The Kish Bank is but one of a series of underwater sandbanks that run parallel to the east coast of Ireland, stretching from Wexford in the south to Dublin Bay in the north. One of the most treacherous of these sandbanks is the Kish Bank. Master Samuel Bissett and 18 of his crew survived; one crew member was drowned. The vessel was clearly off-course when lost and a subsequent inquiry in Dublin found that the ship’s compass had been affected by the large cargo of iron carried on board, a problem compounded by carelessness on the master’s part in navigating the vessel. It was estimated that the value of the loss of the vessel was £3,000, with another £4,000 lost on the cargo.

The Sir Charles Napier measures 33m in length, 7m in width and 1.7m in maximum height and lies orientated NW–SE on a sandy seabed in a general sea depth of 8m. A survey by Roy Stokes of Marlin Sub Aqua Club in 2003 identified the wreck as that of the Sir Charles Napier. Even though the wreck was partially salvaged at the time, part of the cargo still remains on board, including crockery, iron skillets and faggots of iron.

Vanguard (HMS),W02099,Ironclad Battleship,"Wicklow, Bray Head, 12 miles E by N",01/09/1875,53.21296,-5.77187,GSI_255,"The HMS Vanguard was one of four Audacious class, ironclad battleships built by Cammel Laird & Co. at
Birkenhead, England, at a cost of £355,000. The 6,034-ton vessel was powered by steam and sail and was capable of attaining speeds up to 14 knots. The 6-inch-thick iron hull was reinforced along its waterline and an iron ram was attached to the bow below the waterline. Her armoury included both 6-inch and 9-inch guns. It was completed in September 1870 and commissioned into service as a guardship at Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). On 1 September 1875 the Vanguard, under the command of Captain Richard Dawkins, went to sea on manoeuvres with five other ironclad battleships of the Reserve Squadron of the Channel Fleet and the yacht Hawk. Shortly after departing Kingstown for Queenstown (now Cobh), Co. Cork, the formation encountered thick fog and the Vanguard was accidentally rammed by her sister ship, HMS Iron Duke. As water flowed into the damaged battleship, her internal compartments were incapable of containing the flow and she began to sink. The boiler furnaces were soon extinguished, depriving her of power, and within an hour the Vanguard sank. Fortunately, no lives were lost in this incident as the 360 men on board managed to get safely into lifeboats and board the Iron Duke. The Iron Duke, with its bow damaged, returned to Dún Laoghaire. Nine days later a court martial was quickly convened on board the HMS Adelaide, during which Captain Dawkins and four of his officers were severely reprimanded for failing to save the ship. Limited salvage work was carried out on the wreck and attempts by the British Admiralty to raise it came to nothing due to difficult and dangerous diving conditions.

The wreck of the HMS Vanguard measures 93m in length, 14m in width and 15m in maximum height. The vessel lies E–W on a sandy seabed in a general sea depth of 45m and lists slightly towards her starboard side. In conditions of good visibility – most commonly experienced early in the diving season, in May – the Vanguard is one of the most spectacular shipwrecks in Ireland. The wreck is very intact, but has broken its back aft of the box battery, where there is a 2m split, and sits with a list of 30 degrees to starboard. The
damage caused by the Iron Duke’s ram is clearly visible on the port side forward of the box battery, and coal is strewn around the seabed in this area. The stump of the mainmast leads out into the scour pit to starboard. When she was first dived in the 1980s, it was possible to enter the main deck through the break and swim all the way aft and exit through the officers’ quarters, but now the top deck has collapsed down and slid to starboard, which has also caused the 2m port gunwales to collapse. On the collapsed aft top deck the remains of the helm position, which once held very intact 2m teak and brass wheels and the capstan, are also prominent. The port Griffiths screw – a very early and strange-looking propeller design – is well worth a visit. Its starboard partner is now nearly buried under sand and collapsing wreckage
down in the scour, at 50m. In the box battery itself some of the main deck 9-inch muzzle-loaders are visible if you venture into the break, but a number have now collapsed down into the bowels of the wreck. The most easily seen are the two oblique firing guns on the port top deck of the battery, at around 35m. Forward the 2m gunwales are still intact and a 64lb chaser gun and an anchor are to be found on the port bow. The bow itself is majestic in good visibility, with the underwater ram clearly visible, below the point of
which sits another enormous anchor.

A line of framing timbers and hull planking can be revealed, overlain with ballast stones and interspersed with broken pottery and barrel material, denoting the cargo carried. The artefacts recovered provide a probable date of the 18th century for the wreck and its assemblage suggests it was probably a trader. In 2014, following a report of interference with the protected wreck site, the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) of the National Monuments Service, Department of Culture, Heritage & the Gaeltacht carried out survey and targeted excavation at the site of this wreck, on the lower foreshore of Ballyheigue Strand. Fragments of broken pottery, green glass bottles and barrel material had been scattered due to damage by those who impacted the wreck site. The revealed extent of the wreck was surveyed and a discreet area opened to allow recovery of damaged material and investigation into the wreck itself. All work was subject to tidal movements and therefore the tidal window was short, resulting in limited time on the wreck site. Revealed were the remains of a small wooden barrel with a number of broken staves, one retaining a maker’s or merchant’s mark that may provide a provenance. Within the barrel were four green glass bottles that unfortunately had been recently broken. Within the impacted area too as well as scattered across the site was recovered fragments of Westerwald pottery of 18th-century date and other ceramics including Frechen ware and Staffordshire cream ware. Faunal remains too were recovered, including bird bones. The wreck had previously been the focus of investigation by local historian Mr Edward Roe in the 1960s, when a large area was opened up and intact Westerwald jugs and cups were recovered, Staffordshire wares including a full tea set and 3 tricorne felt hats in a state of perfect preservation. All these are now housed as part of the Edward Roe Collection of Kerry County Museum. Mr Roe carried out extensive research and suggested that the wreck was that of the Wind Trader, lost in Ballyheigue in the year 1746. While the cargo would certainly suggest such a date, 8 other wrecks dating to the 18th and 19th centuries were lost at or near Ballyheigue, so it is not fully certain if the wreck excavated is that of the Wind Trader. Research is ongoing by the UAU on the material excavated from the site and this may provide positive evident for the wreck’s identity.","Kelleher 2015, 16-20; Kelleher, 2018; Murray, & C.

Unknown 'Duncannon 2 Wreck',W11617,Unknown,"Duncannon Bar, on western edge of the navigation channel leading into Waterford Harbour.",circa 1543,52.1938,-6.93976,National Monuments Service,"Little is known about this wreck apart from the information that has been gleaned from the half dozen fragmented timbers that were recovered from the dredge head in 2003 during the archaeological monitoring undertaken by the Underwater Archaeology Unit, National Monuments Service (NMS) of the dredging programme at that time. These comprised oak timbers detached from a more substantial structure and made up of a number of both framing and planking timbers. As the timbers blocked the head of the dredger it was lifted out of the water and this allowed both the timbers to be recovered but also a location to be ascertained for where the blockage occurred and thus a location for the wreck site itself. Subsequent dendrochronological dating carried out by Dr Aoife Daly supplied a date from the timbers of 1543AD. Geophysical survey carried out by Dr Rory Quinn of the University of Coleraine in Ulster for NMS in 2003 imaged the sub-surface remains of the wreck and indications are that a substantial part of the wreck may be buried up to 3m beneath the seabed, including possible decking timbers identifiable in the sub-bottom profile images. Whether Duncannon 2 Wreck was a sister-ship of the Post (W05126), another Tudor-period wreck lost nearby in Tramore Bay in 1566AD or whether it is an unrelated vessel from the same period remains a mystery.",Kelleher 2004; Quinn 2003,1543

Unknown 'Duncannon Wreck',W18543,Unknown,"Duncannon Bar, on the western side slope of the navigation channel, Waterford Harbour",c. 1640s-1660s,52.19292,-6.94033,National Monuments Service,"This substantial wreck was discovered in 2002 during dredging operations by Waterford Port, when archaeological monitoring by The Archaeological Diving Company Ltd. (ADCO) recovered timbers from the dredge head. Subsequent survey and investigation by ADCO identified it as a large, wooden wreck, lying partially exposed on the seabed, with both structural and decking timbers visible as well as a line of iron cannon protruding from the wreck. The Underwater Archaeology Unit of the National Monuments Service carried out excavation at the wreck site in 2003 & 2004 and revealed more of the wreck and its constructional detail.  The Duncannon 1 Wreck is a mid-17th century wreck that was discovered through the archaeological monitoring of dredging operations undertaken by Waterford Port Company in 2002. Recovered at the time were several large timbers that allowed for a fixed location to be determined. Prior to that, during geophysical survey of the harbor. Mr Donal Boland in 2000 had identified several anomalies that suggested a wreck was located in the general area. ADCO’s archaeological monitor on board was able to suspend dredging in that area when timbers blocked the dredge head and subsequent dive inspection and assessment by ADCO reported that a substantial wooden wreck was located partly revealed in the soft sands of Duncannon Bar. A number of artefacts were recovered by ADCO at the time, including rigging elements, anchor, quern stone, munitions, leather and pottery. Remaining on the seabed, protruding from the wreck structure, are a line of large and medium iron cannon, some possibly within their gun ports. The Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) of the National Monuments Service carried out further survey and excavation at the wreck site in 2003 and 2004 to ascertain what part of the wreck was revealed and to obtain more detailed information on the guns and lead objects within the wreck. Timber decking was exposed during the excavation and the four circular lead objects visible appear to be possible pissdales or ‘heads’ (toilets on board the ship) still within their structural location; the iron guns comprise both large guns and one medium gun, which appear to be English. All bar the medium gun which lies horizontally on the seabed, are vertical with their breech ends facing upwards. Though a positive identification was not made, dating of the guns suggests that the wreck dates to the mid-part of the 17th century (Ruth Browne gun assessment) and are English. During the Irish Rebellion period of 1643-1653, several ships were lost off or around Waterford Harbour, which was one of the main focal points for Royalist, Confederate Irish and Parliamentary maritime engagement. In 1645 the Great Lewis, flagship of the Parliamentary Navy, engaged in supporting and supplying the Parliamentary troops in Duncannon Fort, was bombarded by the Royalist and Confederate Irish during the siege of the Fort and was lost about a mile down harbour of the Fort. The dating evidence from Duncannon 1 Wreck, type of guns and size timbers revealed, which suggest they formed part of a large ship, suggests the wreck may be that of the Great Lewis. More definitive evidence is required, however, to positively state that Duncannon 1 wreck is the Great Lewis or that of another ship lost in the harbour at that time.","Brady & McCullough 2003; Kelleher 2004; Kelleher, 2009; Quinn 2003",

It is hoped that further research, survey work and investigations by divers will some day confirm whether this is the case. The Rask was a Norwegian steel steamship of 632 tons,
equipped with triple-expansion engines. It was built in 1890 by the Dutch shipbuilders A. A. Wilton van Reede Czn, Papendrecht, and named the Göteborg. Initially owned by D/S A/S Marstrand (D. Torm) Copenhagen, the vessel was purchased by Olaus Kvilhaug & Co. A/S, Haugesund, Norway, in 1917 and renamed the Uno. It was purchased in 1924 by Sigvart Rasmussen, Haugesund, and renamed the Rask, and was eventually acquired by D/S A/S Rask (Sigvald Risanger) in April 1937. Apart from the everyday risks shipping had to endure while at sea, such as bad weather and rough seas, merchant shipping also had to contend with the threat posed by U-boats, mines and aircraft throughout the battle of the Atlantic. German long-range aircraft, mostly Focke-Wulf Fw200 Condors, bombed and strafed shipping off the Irish coast, as well as acting as spotters for U-boats, earning themselves a reputation as the ‘scourge of the Atlantic’. The Rask was to suffer such a fate at their hands. At about 6.30pm on 19 September 1941 the vessel came under attack from three German aircraft near Tuskar Rock, off the coast of Co. Wexford. The Rask, with 16
crewmen, was under the command of Captain Sigurd M.J. Martinessen and en route from Cork to Newport, Wales, in ballast. Two of the planes are believed to have been hit during the exchange of fire, with one of them possibly downed by the Rask’s five machine guns, which were manned by both crewmen and gunners. The undamaged plane returned and scored a direct hit, causing irreparable damage to the Rask, and she sank not long afterwards. The starboard lifeboat left the ship with five men on board and landed at Blackwater, Co. Wexford, the next morning. The port lifeboat, with 12 men on board, unfortunately
capsized several times, with seven fatalities brought about by exposure. The remaining crewmen on the lifeboat were rescued at about 6.00am by the British vessel Wallace Rose. The wreck of the Rask measures 57m in length, 12m in width and 9.55m in maximum height, with an average height of 5.4m. The vessel is orientated NE–SW on the seafloor.","Brady et. al. 2012, 143; Hocking 1989, 580; Larn & Larn 2002; Hocking 1989, 580; Roche 1993, 121, 132; Woodman 2004, 253; UKHO Wreck Data; www.warsailors.com",1941

Sydney Wignall, assisted by Colin Martin, carried out a survey and limited excavation on the wreck site in 1968-70. The wreck is on a flat shingle bottom in 35 - 40 meters. It was discovered that much of the lower forward hull was intact as it was pinned by the packed limestone ballast which had lined the hold. The mound of ballast measures 100 feet x 40 feet and averaging 2 - 2.5 feet deep. There are massive concretions of piled shot at the north and NW (bow) end of the mound. 7 lead ingots were found on the ballast. Two matching pewter plates with the name Matute carved into them were used to identify the wreck. Excavation uncovered the keelson and the mainmast step, with indications of collapse.

GSI Wreck No. GSI_248.  5657-ton, 3-year-old, four-masted steel steamship of Manchester, owned by Manchester Liner Company, Lim., Manchester. Built in 1900 by Palmers’ Shipbuilding and Iron Company Ltd., Newcastle-upon Tyne. Measured 452 x 52 x 28ft. Powered by 3-cylindfer triple expansion 642 Hp triple boiler screw engine and was classed by Lloyd’s as ‘100 A1. shelter deck.’ Although originally built for the newly formed Manchester Liner Company Ltd., it was requisitioned by the British Government immediately after its completion to transport troops, supplies, horses and ammunition to South Africa during the Boer War (1899–1902). After the war the SS Manchester Merchant was returned to its owners. It was lost during its first voyage, while en route from New Orleans to Manchester with a cargo of 13,000  bales of cotton for the Lancashire cotton mills. The vessel, commanded by W.P. Couch and manned by a crew of 56, was also carrying 100 barrels of turpentine, soap, pitch, pine and grain. It is believed that the cotton cargo ignited, with the vessel subsequently catching fire as it neared the southwest coast of Ireland. The cargo ship sought refuge in Dingle Bay and dropped anchor near the entrance to Castlemaine harbour. As the fire intensified, the crew to threw the turpentine overboard. With efforts to fight the fire proving fruitless, most of the crew took to the lifeboats, leaving the master and a handful of crew to scuttle the ship in shallow water, which they did on 15 January. There was no loss of life in this incident. The captain gave the ship’s bell to locals as a token of gratitude for their assistance. The bell of the Manchester Merchant is housed in the Roman Catholic church at Anascaul, Co. Kerry.

The wreck of the SS Manchester Merchant lies in over 11m of water and is orientated NE–SW, with its bow to the NE. It lies largely intact and measures 157m in length and 18m in width.

Muirchú,W04039,Cruiser,"Saltees, Co. Wexford, 5.1km SW",8/5/47,52.069,-6.58515,INFOMAR Wreck Data; GSI Wreck No_272,"The SS Muirchú was originally named Helga II when it was built by the Dublin Dockyard Company in 1908 as a fishery protection cruiser for the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. The 323-ton cruiser was propelled by 130 horsepower, triple-expansion engines and was capable of attaining a speed of 9 knots. It measured  47.24m long and 7.46m wide. As World War I progressed and the heavy loss of Allied vessels continued, Helga II was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in March 1915. The “II” was dropped and the newly renamed HMY Helga, which was reclassified as an Armed Auxiliary Patrol Yacht, was fitted with a 12-pounder and a 3-pounder gun. For the duration of the war HMY Helga was based in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), Co. Dublin, and was primarily engaged in anti-submarine patrols and escort duties in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea. During the 1916 Easter Rising, the Helga shelled rebel positions in Dublin city centre, including Boland’s Mills, Liberty Hall and the Dublin Distillery. In February 1918 the Helga attacked a submarine off the Isle of Man, and even though the U-boat escaped back to its base, for the remainder of her career the Helga carried a star on her funnel as a reminder of this achievement. Another notable achievement of the Helga was its involvement in the rescue of 90 people from the RMS Leinster, which had been torpedoed and sunk, with the loss of 501 people, off the Dublin coast in October 1918. In 1919 the Helga resumed its fisheries duties and was transferred to the newly formed Free State government in 1922. With the outbreak of the Civil War (1922–3), the Helga was commandeered by the Free State Army’s Marine Investigation Department for coastal patrol duties. She was used in the transportation of Free State troops along the Munster coastline, and for bringing relief supplies to counties Galway and Sligo. The vessel was also used in the transportation of Republican prisoners from Donegal to Dublin. With hostilities coming to a close, the Helga was transferred to the Irish Free State’s Department of  Agriculture in May 1923 and earmarked for fisheries work. In August of the same year the vessel was once again recruited for naval duties, this time with the newly established Coastal and Marine Service, and renamed the Muirchú, after the 7th-century cleric and biographer of St Patrick. This naval service was disbanded by a cash strapped government in March 1924, with the Muirchú returned to the Department of Agriculture to carry on with her task of fishery protection. The outbreak of World War II saw the Muirchú being taken over by a new Marine and Coastwatching Service in December 1939, and refitted for her wartime task of anti-submarine patrols. Later in the war she was also used for mine-clearing duties. In 1947 the Muirchú was the first ship to be commissioned into the newly formed Irish Naval Service. It never saw service, unfortunately, and with the arrival of three Flower class corvettes, purchased from the Royal Navy, the 39-year-old cruiser was decommissioned. The vessel was sold for scrap to the Hammond Lane Foundry in Dublin, but foundered while on tow from Haulbowline to Dublin, 5.1km southwest of the Saltee Islands, in May 1947. There was no loss of life. 

The wreck of the Muirchú is orientated NW–SE and measures 48.5m in length, 7m in width and 3.6m in maximum height. It lies on its port side and is badly broken up, however one rather curious sight is that of a completely intact bath sitting amongst the wreckage. There is an area of deep scouring at the SE end of the wreck and aft the starboard propeller is missing a blade.","Brady et. al. 2012, 173-4; Collins 2002; Larn & Larn 2002; National Museum of Ireland.",1947

GSI Wreck No. 215. 6446/6500-ton 10-year-old steam liner owned by the Booth S.S. Co. Ltd., Liverpool, classed 100 A1 by Lloyd’s. Built in 1907 by Hawthorn Leslie and Co. of Newcastle at a cost of £123,000. Powered by 850nhp triple expansion engines and was capable of 14 knots and was armed with a 6 inch QF stern gun. En route from Para to Liverpool with a cargo of rubber / general cargo. Captain was A. W. Stoker when torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine UC-48. 55 lives were lost, captain survived. Without warning the ANTONY was struck by a torpedo from the UC-48 at 2.30pm on the port side and the engine was at once stopped. The Antony was abandoned immediately, but 55 lives were lost during the course of evacuation, with only 75 survivors eventually landed at Cobh, Co. Cork. The liner was torpedoed twice more and bombarded with several shells, causing it to catch fire and sink. The Antony was one of four vessels sunk over a two-day period off the Wexford and Waterford coasts by UC-48.
The wreck of the Antony measures 133m in length, 20m in width and 6m maximum height, with an average height of 2.2m. The vessel is orientated NNW–SSE on the seafloor. She appears to be partly buried and/or broken up as it was partially salvaged at some point, exposing some of its cargo of rubber. The Antony lies in two main pieces and many dives are needed on each piece to get one’s bearings. She lies in 57m of water on one side, with her bilge keel facing up. Most of her triple-expansion steam engines stick out clear of the hull plating. Two of her five boilers can clearly be seen poking their way through tears in the hull’s
steelwork, wide enough for the adventurous diver to visit inside. What is most striking to the diver is the seemingly endless rows of round portholes studded along the almost horizontal hull plating when swimming down towards the small debris field between the wreck and the seabed.

owned by the City of Cork Steam Packet Company Ltd. Grossing 1,456 tons, the vessel was propelled by a 394 horsepower, three-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engine that provided speeds up to 14.5 knots. Given that the Bandon was plying her trade in dangerous times, the vessel was armed with one 3-pounder gun on the stern for defensive purposes. However, lightly armed merchant vessels could do little to fend off the menace of U-boats, which attacked without warning. The Cork Steam Packet Navigation Company suffered badly during World War I at the hands of U-boats, with the loss of six of its cargo steamers: Inniscarra, Innisfallen, Ardmore, Lismore, Kenmare and Bandon. The SS Bandon was en route from Liverpool to Cork,
under the command of Captain P.F. Kelly, when it was either torpedoed or mined by UC-44 (Kapitänleutnant
Kurt Tebbenjohanns) late on the afternoon of Friday, 13 April 1917. The torpedo struck the port side, disabling the engine room and causing the ship to sink immediately, 5km southwest of Mine Head. The 1,050-ton cargo was lost in the attack, along with 28 members of the crew. Only four crew members, including the ship’s master, were rescued by a motor launch sent by the Mine Head Lighthouse, after spending 2.5 hours in the water. They were landed at Dungarvan. The UC-44 was responsible for sinking 29 other ships during World War I. Less than a year later, Captain P.F. Kelly survived another U-boat attack when the SS Inniscarra, which he was commanding, was torpedoed and sunk by U-86 off the Waterford coast, once again with the loss of 28 lives.

The wreck of the SS Bandon measures 81.9m in length, 11.5m in width and 5.5m in maximum height. The vessel is badly broken up and lies in a general sea depth of 33m and is orientated almost E–W, with its bow lying to the E.

(Alfred Holt Group). It was built by Scott & Co. Ltd. Of Greenock, Scotland, in 1899 at a cost of £83,983. The vessel had a single screw, was powered by a three-cylinder, triple-expansion engine and was armed with one 4.7-inch, stern-mounted gun. At the time of its loss the Calchas was under charter to the Cunard Line, bringing vital food supplies and 10,000 tons of munitions from New York to Liverpool for the war effort. It was attacked without warning by U-80 (under the command of Kapitänleutnant Alfred von Glasenapp), with one torpedo striking the vessel’s port side. It took an hour for the Calchas to sink, allowing plenty of time for Captain R.T. Jon and his 67 crew members to abandon the ship using four lifeboats. They were picked up soon afterwards by a naval ship and disembarked safely at Cobh, Co. Cork. The Calchas was one
of two ships sunk on 11 May 1917 off the southwest coast of Ireland by U-80. Although it was reported at the time that the Calchas had sunk 5 miles west by south of Inistearaght Rocks, in the early 1950s the salvage company Risdon Beazley Marine Ltd located the wreck 28km west of Valentia Island. Approximately 269 tons of nickel was salvaged in 1954 and 1957.

The wreck of the Calchas measures 72m in length, 23m in width and 7.9m in maximum height, with an average height of 5m. The vessel is orientated NE–SW on the seafloor. A deep sediment scour has developed at the NE end of the vessel.

Karina (SS),W03818,Steel Steamship,"Waterford, Hook Head, 34km SW of.",1/8/17,51.8247,-7.0472,GSI_223,"The Karina was a 4,222-ton steamship built by Alexander Stephen & Sons, Linthouse, Glasgow, in 1905 and was employed on the Glasgow and Liverpool service to West Africa. It was one of two ‘Karina’ class steamships owned by the African Steam Navigation Company (Elder Dempster & Co. Ltd.), the other being the SS Mendi. Both vessels were lost during the war: the Karina with the loss of 11 lives; the Mendi with the loss of 646 crew and passengers, mostly personnel from the South African Native Labour Corp, after being accidentally rammed by the SS Darro off the Isle of Wight. The Karina’s triple expansion engines produced 422 horsepower, making it capable of speeds up to 12.5 knots. It had a 3-inch, stern-mounted gun for defensive purposes. On 30 July the Karina narrowly escaped being torpedoed during a U-boat attack off the west coast of Ireland, whilst en route from Sierra Leone to Liverpool with a 2,000-ton cargo of palm oil and palm kernels. Captain J.C. Hannay must have felt blessed to have had such a lucky escape, but his luck ran out just two days later when UC-75, under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Johannes Lohs, torpedoed the vessel without warning, hitting the no. 3 hold towards the aft of the ship. The Karina began to sink quickly and even though all six boats on board were launched, four passengers and seven crewmen drowned.

The wreck of the Karina measures 106m in length and 28m in width, with an average height of 2.7m. The vessel is orientated NW–SE on the seafloor and appears to be partly buried, but three of its boilers stand 5.9m above the seabed. In 1985 the recovery of the ship’s bell by Seasalve Marine confirmed the wreck to be the Karina.

Aud (SS),W07957,Ship,"Cork Harbour Approaches, 9km south of Roches Point, Co Cork",21/04/1916,51.71132,-8.24033,UKHO Wreck Data,"Originally an English merchant vessel, the 1228-ton steamship (L.250 x B.35 x D.16ft) was originally owned by the Wilson Line, Hull. Captured by the Germans in 1914, her name was changed from Castro to Libau and  renamed again to Aud when disguised as a Norwegian freighter which she resembled and despatched to Ireland in 1916 to deliver a shipment of arms for the Easter Rising. She sailed from Wilhelmshaven, under Captain Karl Spindler, arriving off the Kerry coast on April 20th but, due to confused communications, it was unsuccessful in landing its cargo as planned in Fenit Harbour. The ship was subsequently intercepted by the Royal Navy while attempting to escape into the deeper waters of the Atlantic. While under escort to Queenstown Harbour, now Cobh, Co. Cork, the Captain of the Aud, Karl Spindler, scuttled the ship rather than have it fall into enemy hands. The Aud was carrying 20,000 rifles, captured from the Russians in 1914, a small number of machine guns, a number of giant “clockwork” bombs and I million rounds of ammunition. In the meantime, Sir Roger Casement, who had negotiated the arms shipment with Germany, was put ashore off a German U-Boat on Banna Strand on April 21st, in the hope of rendezvousing with the Aud.  He was subsequently arrested, tried for treason and executed on August 3rd 1916. 

Two anchors were recovered from the wreck in 2012 by a dive team led by Eoin McGarry, working under the supervision of Laurence Dunne archaeologist. The anchors were subsequently conserved under the supervision of Ian Panter, Principal Conservator of York Archaeological Trust, in accordance with the requirements of the National Museum of Ireland and they were ready for display at Banna beach in time for the commemoration of the Easter Rising in Kerry in 2016. One anchor is now on display in Blennerville Windmill Museum, Tralee, Co. Kerry and the other in the visitor centre, Cobh Co. Cork. The wreck of the Aud and its contents belongs to the State. It is also protected under the 1987 National Monuments (amendment) Act which affords protection to all wrecks over 100 years old.

La Surveillante,W08507,Frigate,"Bantry Bay, 1.2 miles NW of Whiddy Island,
Co. Cork",02/01/1797,51.70383,-9.54112,GSI Wreck Data (Wreck No_258),"UKHO Wreck No. 011400560. La Surveillante was a 620-ton French frigate built in Lorient in 1778. It measured 43m in length and carried 32 guns. The vessel had three masts and was copper sheathed to protect the hull from damage by marine organisms. The vessel was involved in a number of successful naval engagements with British warships during the American War of Independence (1775–82). However, La Surveillante is probably best known for its defeat of the English frigateQuebec in 1779, off the coast of Ushant. In 1796 La Surveillante took part in the unsuccessful attempt by France to invade Ireland. The enterprise seemed doomed from the outset, with bad weather and poor leadership resulting in the 48-strong French invasion fleet being scattered and dispersed. Although most of the storm-battered fleet arrived off Bantry, Co. Cork, on 19 December, continued bad weather, poor decision-making by the captains and further loss of ships forced the fleet to return to France without ever setting foot on Irish soil. La Surveillante was considered unseaworthy for the return journey and was scuttled by its crew in Bantry Bay. Its crew and all 600 cavalry and troops on board were transferred safely to other French ships in the fleet. Of the 48 ships that left Brest on 16 December 1796, only 36 returned to France: the rest were either captured by the English Navy or wrecked 

The wreck of La Surveillante was discovered in 1981 during seabed clearance operations following the Betelgeuse oil tanker disaster. Two years earlier, in 1979, the Betelgeuse had caught fire and blew up at the Whiddy oil terminal, with the loss of 60 lives. Prior to this, one of La Surveillante’s anchors had been trawled up by fishermen and put on display in Bantry, but the presence of the wreck itself had remained unknown, until the events in 1979–81. In 1987 two 12-pound cannons were raised from the wreck, and in 1997 the UAU lifted the ship’s bell. The bell is currently on display in the Bantry Armada Centre, at Bantry House. The wreck of La Surveillante measures 42m in length, 10m in width and 4.3m in maximum height and is orientated NE–SW, with her bow to the NE. Copper sheathing is visible along the length of the wreck. The galley area, cannon, cannon balls and an anchor are also visible on the wreck","Bartlett, T., 1997, 72; Brady et. al. 2012 28-9; Breen C. 2001; Bourke 1994, 145-46; Freeman's Journal Thursday 12th January 1797 Vol. XXXV1 No 25; Hildred, A., 1990; O’Mahony & Cadogan 1988, 23-24; Lloyd's List No. 15, 256, Thursday 15th July 1886; Quinn et.

U-58,W10138,Submarine,"Power Head, Co. Cork, 20km S of",17/11/1917,51.60564,-8.16487,GSI Wreck Data,"U-58 is one of 15 German submarines that were destroyed in Irish waters during World War I. It is particularly interesting because it is the only U-boat definitely sunk by the U.S. Navy during the war. It was one of only 12 type U-57s ever constructed, being built in the A.G. Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1916. It was launched on 31 May that year and was commissioned into service on 9 August 1916. Type U-57 submarines were capable of speeds of 14.7 knots on the surface and 8.4 knots underwater. They had a surface weight of 786 tons, could reach a depth of 50m and carried a crew of 36 men. They were armed with 11 torpedoes and two deck guns – one 10.5cm and one 8.8cm gun.

On 10 November 1917, U-58 departed Wilhelmshaven for its eighth, and what turned out to be its final, patrol. Four days later, in the English Channel, it sank the Dolly Varden, a 202-ton British sailing ship; there was no loss of life. The U-58 proceeded to the Irish coast and on 15 November positioned itself at the approaches to Cork harbour to attack Allied vessels leaving port. Two days later it was spotted by USS Fanning and another destroyer, USS Nicholson, which attempted to sink the U-boat with a series of depth charges. Despite making an emergency descent, the depth charges destroyed the hydroplanes of the U-58, making it impossible to control the submarine underwater. The disabled U-boat was forced to surface and came under gunfire from the two destroyers. Given their untenable situation, Kapitänleutnant Gustav Amberger ordered his crew to assemble on deck to surrender and await rescue. Two crew members returned below to scuttle the submarine with explosive charges or by opening the seacocks, and as they re-emerged the submarine began to sink. Amberger and his crew jumped from the sinking vessel into the sea and were rescued by USS Fanning, except for two officers: one who drowned; and a second officer who died on board the Fanning and was later buried at sea. The captured crew were taken to Cobh, before being transferred to the custody of the Royal Navy and transported onwards to Britain. The U-58 had been in service for 13 months, during which time it had sunk 21ships, with the loss of 17 lives and 30,906 tons of shipping.","Brady et. al. 2012, 87-9; GSI wreck Data; Grant 2002, 68; Kieran & Hayden 2011; Kemp 1997, 38; Mallmann Showell 2006, 145–6; Möller & Brack 2004, 29; Nolan & Nolan 2009, 254–5; Stokes 2004, 176, 239; www.uboat.net",1917

This wreck is located in 12m of water on the NW side of Dunworley Bay, Co. Cork. It is a wooden wreck, with 9 iron guns and other artefacts evidence on the seabed. It dates to the early to mid-17th century. It was the focus of several weeks work by the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) from 2003 to 2009. The initial impetus for the work was the assessment of damage to the wreck following treasure-hunting activity at the site. Several ships are recorded as having wrecked in the Bay, and the work done to date on the wreck site, in tandem with historical research and analysis of artefacts from the site, may indicate that this particular wreck could represent a possible pirate slaver from the 1630s.","Kelleher 2011, 138-145; Kelleher 2014, 10.",

While hold up in Matanzas Bay in Cuba awaiting the changing trade winds to take them back to Spain, the Dutch fleet of the West Indies Company under Piet Hein, accomplished privateer and maritime commander entered the narrow mouth of the Bay. He summarily captured the full treasure fleet, taking four of the galleons and the treasure that was in their holds. Making his way back to Holland, triumphantly, some of the ships were scattered by a storm and the Santa Ana Maria, flagship of the 1627 Spanish New World  treasure fleet was separated and in turn was captured by an English privateer, the Dragon. Its captain, in the process of bringing the galleon back to Bristol as a prize, sailed close to the southern coast of Ireland and in another storm sought refuge in Castlehaven. The Spanish vessel underestimated the depth of water and was cast upon the rocks on the eastern edge of the entrance to the Harbour. The wreck was discovered I the 1970s by local divers and several guns and artefacts were recovered at that time. One of the guns from the ship is now housed in the National Museum of Ireland along with other artefacts handed over to the National Museum by divers Mr Sidney and David Woodnam.","Kelleher 2012, 175-182; Kelleher forthcoming",1628

On reef at E side, since called the Looe Rock.",30/04/1697,51.47423,-9.3899,National Monuemnts Service,"This royal ship, one of only 34 such ships built at the time, was the flagship of the Irish Coast Fleet tasked with patrolling the waters around Ireland; it was lost in its first year of service on the jagged rocks of the reef at the entrance to Baltimore Harbour. 385-ton, 5th-rate 32-gun frigate, built in Plymouth in 1696. Put into Baltimore Harbour for provisions and when leaving, during story weather, Captain Paul miscalculated the depth of water and grounded on the reef at the entrance. A green buoy marks the spot. All crew got off and much of its cargo, tackle, etc. was subsequently salvaged shortly afterwards.  In 1698 captain Townsend was court-martialled for selling two of her guns, possibly salved by himself. Captain Paul was court-martialled for negligence. The HMS Looe was one of only 34 such ‘demi-batterie’ ships built under the design of Lord Torrington and is thus an important wreck in that it provides information on this specific ship type. In 2001 the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU) of the National Monuments Service carried out a survey of the wreck site and found up to 7 iron guns and numerous cannon balls at various depths on the reef and on the sea floor at 25m depth. The guns are heavily concreted, as are the cannonballs which are massed together. Some of the guns are broken with short sections only present, and whether these represent broken ordnance carried on the ship as ballast or if they were broken subsequent to the wrecking is not known. No structural evidence was found, which is not surprising at the Looe Rock and entrance area of Baltimore Harbour is a highly dynamic zone, with substantial movements of water, making the survival of any wooden elements from the HMS Looe unlikely in that location.

the Mauritania, was the pride of the Cunard Line when it
was built in 1906. The liner was designed by the engineer
Leonard Peskett and built by John Brown & Co. Ltd. of
Glasgow. It was finished in June 1906 and fitted out for
her maiden voyage to New York, which was scheduled for
the following September. Its arrival in New York was a
major event, with the ship receiving a rapturous welcome
and hailed as the finest ship in the world. The building of
the Lusitania had stemmed from a low-interest loan given
to the owners by the British government, which required
fast Atlantic civilian liners capable of being pressed into
naval service as auxiliary cruisers at a moment’s notice. The
ship was the largest ship ever built at the time, protected
by high tensile steel plating, capable of travelling at 25
knots and with its important equipment located below
the waterline, to protect it from shellfire during hostilities.
Another innovation was the electric controls for steering,
detecting fire and closing the watertight compartments, of
which there were 175. Four giant steam-turbine engines
were fitted instead of the usual reciprocating pistons –
the first time a merchant ship had been fitted out in this
way. Provision was also made for 12 revolving wheels
or gun rings for six 6-inch guns, as well as a number of
compartments that could be used as magazines to hold
shell stockpiles. There were first-class cabins amidships
and the ship was luxuriously fitted out, with the firstclass
dining room and smoking room decorated in the
neo-classical style of the 18th century. The second- and
third-class accommodation was also of a relatively high
standard. In providing this comfort for its less well-off
passengers, Cunard was recognising the importance of the
large number of third-class passengers, in particular, who
would make the one-way journey to America as emigrants,
thus bolstering significantly the profits of the Company.
Despite these modifications to make the liner suitable
for conversion to an auxiliary cruiser, when war broke
out in 1914 plans to use the Lusitania as a naval vessel
were shelved due to its enormous coal consumption.
Having successfully made five return trips to New York
from Liverpool following the outbreak of hostilities, the
Lusitania was once again en route to Liverpool in May
1915, on her 101st Atlantic crossing. She was carrying
1,257 passengers and 702 crew. While fast liners, like the
Lusitania, routinely carried munitions to Britain, in the
opinion of the German government, the Lusitania was
carrying contraband, in the sense of goods forbidden to
be supplied by neutrals to those engaged in war. This is
still a controversial issue as under regulations governing
American shipping at the time, it was permissible for the
Lusitania to be carrying what were termed small arms
ammunition, non explosive in bulk. In this regard, the
Lusitania carried 1,248 cases of 3.3-inch shrapnel shells
(unfilled), 4,927 cases of rifle bullets with around 1,000
cartridges per case, 3,240 percussion fuses for 6-inch
shells and 46 tons of aluminium powder. Furthermore,
on 30 April, shortly before sailing, 70 passengers and 200
tons of cargo were transferred from the Queen Margaret
to the Lusitania, and part of the transferred cargo was
ammunition. We know this because the archives of the
Remington Arms Company include a letter that refers to
the loading of 2,000 cases of small arms ammunition on
to the Queen Margaret, and attached to this letter was
a Cunard receipt for 2,000 cases of .303 ammunition,
with the name Queen Margaret cancelled and Lusitania
written across it. Again this has been a source of
controversy over the years, but it was apparently common
practice for a ship to embark on an abbreviated manifest
and to supply a full one after leaving port. In the case of
the Lusitania the complete manifest liste","The Annual Register for 1906, 17, 30-1; The Annual Register for 1915, 13; Ballard, 1995; Bourke 1994, 114; Bourke 1998, 161; Brady et. al 2012; BVLS 1914-18, 6; GSI Wreck Data; Hocking, 1989, 436-7; Larn & Larn 2002; Lloyd’s List, No. 22, 563, Mon. 17th Jan. 1910, 8; Lloyd’s List, No. 23, 312, Mon. 17th Jun. 1912, 9, c.22; Lloyd’s List, No. 23, 312, Mon. 17th Jun. 1912, 10; Lloyd’s List, No. 31, 480, Sat. 8th May 1915, 9 c.19; Lloyd's List No. 33, 629, Wednesday 10th May 1922; Lloyd's List No. 33, 631, Friday 12th May 1922; Lloyd's List 33, 854, Thursday 1st February 1923; Lloyd's List 34, 180, Saturday 23rd February 1924; Lloyd's List 34, 212, Tuesday 1st April 1924; Lloyd's List 34, 089, Wednesday 7th November 1923; Lloyd's List 34, 410, Saturday 22nd November 1924; Lloyd's List 34730, Tuesday 8th December 1925; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 571, Sat. 5th Dec. 1931, 7; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 585, Tue. 22nd Dec. 1931, 9; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 612, Mon. 25th Jan. 1932, 8; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 616, Fri. 29th Jan. 1932, 11; Lloyd’s List, No. 37, 041, Sat. 17th Jun. 1933, 6; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 571, Sat. 5th Dec. 1931, 7; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 585, Tue. 22nd Dec. 1931, 9; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 612, Mon. 25th Jan. 1932, 8; Lloyd’s List, No. 36, 616, Fri. 29th Jan. 1932, 11; Lloyd’s List, No. 37, 041, Sat. 17th Jun. 1933, 6; Lloyd’s List, No. 39, 559, Monday 8th September 1941, 5; Maloney 2004; Moore 2012 60-65; Mulvihill, 1995, 12-27; PP 1919, Vol. XLII; Preston 2002; Simpson 1996; Tapson, 1994, 22-28; UKHO Wreck Data 1996.",1915

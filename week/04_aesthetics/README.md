## It moves

Good design catches our attention, but it also tells a story. In Frank Chimero's *[The Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/)*, he writes:

> What is the marker of good design? It moves.

By "moves," Chimero does not mean that it needs to move literally. The thing can also be perfectly still, so long as it moves *you*. Of course, some good design does indeed move literally, as in the map above. This collaborative project, published by *High Country News*, investigates expropriated indigenous land in what's now known as the United States that was granted to universities through the Morrill Act in 1862. 

What makes maps different from other kinds of visual communication is their representation of place. When we see a map, we tend to place ourselves in it or on it or somewhere in relation to it. Imperfect though they may be for capturing the fine-grained, lived experiences of people in places, maps remain some of the best tools we have for the job.

This week, we focus on design. Good design is an important part of making good maps with strong arguments. And while the idea that something can be designed "well" or "good" – that is to say, aesthetically pleasing – is itself deeply subjective, there are, of course, general principles of cartographic design that you should know. This includes theoretical principles, such as...

* basic color theory
* figure-ground relationships
* data classification schemes
  
As well as technical skills and practical knowledge including...

* when & how to generalize data
* when to use a serif vs. sans-serif font
* labeling and text hierarchies
* strategies for titles and supporting text
* map layout

More often than not, you will want to follow these principles when representing spatial data – but just as importantly, you should be familiar with them so that you know when to bend them, break them, and replace them.

# **Introduction and context**

Georeferencing scanned maps provides important insight into historical geographic transformations. Fire insurance and tax atlases – like those displayed in Atlascope – provide some of the most detailed glimpses into these transformations. However, to date, the spatial data that they contain remains largely opaque, at least insofar as GIS are concerned.

In this assignment, you will create spatial data from a georeferenced map. After masking and making control points for a predetermined plate from an urban atlas, you'll load that map into ArcGIS Pro – either as a GeoTIFF or an XYZ tile set –

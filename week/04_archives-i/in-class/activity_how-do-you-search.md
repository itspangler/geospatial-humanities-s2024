In an essay reflecting on digital archives, Jake Hodder and David Beckingham argue that the tools we use today 

> If you have used a digital archive – or platforms like Google Books or JSTOR – you will be familiar with the search box that invites us to enter our ‘key terms’. It has the look and feel of a finding aid that we might use to identify a call number in a physical archive. But, as Ted Underwood (2014) argues, the underlying technology and philosophical principles are vastly different. The search bar does not help us navigate the arrangement of the archive; it allows us to circumvent it. Digital platforms privilege searching over browsing, and that searching has more in common with data mining than document retrieval. The more precise the phrasing, the more efficiently digital search can personalise our results. This is part of the nature of computer search or ‘information retrieval – it is very effective at identifying exact terms and can do so across millions of data points in seconds.

> When we receive our search results, fragments of historical information are recombined from multiple collections and places with little fidelity to original order or provenance. As Sassoon (cited in Sternfeld, 2011: 565) notes, digital archives return results as ‘a databank of orphans which have been removed from their transactional origins and evidence of authorial intent’. Digital archives, then, offer us an unprecedented means to quickly find exactly what we were already looking for. But rarely do we know what we are looking for, even when we think we do. And even more rarely do we know the precise, historical wording that would find it. So, we search by trial and error. We enter a term as a proxy for a broader theme. We refine it. We search again. If we are lucky, we might be able to tie our research question to a distinct and historically stable watchword that reveals dozens of new sources.

When you're doing historical geographical research on the internet, you position yourself within these hybrid archives of new and old. If 

# Activity: How do you search? (20 minutes)

Pair off - just groups of 2 today - and open [Google Search](https://search.google.com). Normally, when you search for something, you probably do it by

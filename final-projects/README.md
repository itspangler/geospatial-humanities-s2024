# Instructions

The final project is an opportunity to collect, process, analyze, and visualize spatial data of your own choosing. Using ArcGIS Pro, you'll choose a topic and elaborate it in three registers: its *conceptual register*, its *technical register*, and its *graphical register*. The final product will result in a **large-format infographic (poster) or an online interactive StoryMap** that describes the research question, data, and methods as well as the analysis and the results. Examples of similar student projects can be found at [Tufts GIS Expo Explorer](https://expoexplorer.it.tufts.edu/). Students may choose to exhibit their work at Tufts' GIS Expo day on May 8 for 25 points (2.5% of overall grade) of extra credit.

**Detailed instructions and requirements will be published soon.**

* notes from call
  * maybe move NLP up a week
  * consider doing a zonal statistics exercise in place of hot spot/change detection
  * advanced cartography
    * contextual cartography, how to use shaded relief? how to use the boundaries? really about how to apply these techniques in practical contexts
    * megyn kelly's work
    * infographic stuff this week?
  * data lab at tufts site has visualization tools for reference
  * fundamentals of infographic design
  * if you do storymaps -- probably give them the choice -- put a hard limit on storymap length
  * in Carolyn's class, there's a day devoted to final projects

# Schedule

Our semester breaks down into three "Parts." During **[Part I](#part-i-fundamentals)** (weeks 1-4), we'll pick up the fundamentals of geospatial humanities. During **[Part II](#part-ii-approaches)** (weeks 5-9), the rubber meets the road as we experiment with various technical and analytical approaches to "doing" the geospatial humanities. During **[Part III](#part-iii-applications)** (weeks 10-15), we pivot towards applying these approaches to specific areas of study,¬†including your own. Both the schedule and its weekly themes are subject to change.

 While this is not imperative, I recommend trying, to the extent that you are able, to complete course assignments **in the order that they are listed under the "Due before class" bullet**.

## Part I: Fundamentals

**January 23 ‚Ä¢ Introductions ‚Ä¢ What is our subject?**

> *Week 1: Defining "geospatial humanities"; critical cartography; kinds of maps; "x" GIS; mapping with purpose.*

* What are the "geospatial humanities?" What are its constitutive objects, and why are *you* interested in them? What defines a "humanistic" approach to geographic information systems and spatial data? How ought we approach these questions from a technical perspective?
* First day of class! Nothing due...

**January 30 ‚Ä¢ Distortion ‚Ä¢ Squashing globes and bending lines**

> *Week 2: Geographic and projected coordinate systems; scale; projecting XY data; tile pyramids.*

* How do we go about displaying round earth as a flat map? What are the basic mathematical and geodetic rules associated with this process? What sacrifices do we have to make in order to "flatten" the globe, and how have those sacrifices been used strategically?
* Due before class:
  * Lab 01: [Learning ArcGIS Pro Basics](../week/01_intro/lab/basics-india.md)

> *Week 3: Evaluating data & sources; data classification; understanding vector & raster models; situated knowledge & strong objectivity; querying; logical operators; sample curation.*

* What is spatial data and what are spatial data models? Where does spatial data come from? How should you understand data in their social context? What ethical considerations should guide how we represent data cartographically?

# Course summary

The humanities are becoming spatial, or maybe we are finally realizing that they always have been. Geography – the stuff of "where," which encompasses material as concrete as the dirt on the earth to concepts as ephemeral as "space" and "belonging" – informs not only how texts, maps, and other objects are produced, but how we encounter them as readers and users. In recent years, improvements in computing technology and advancements in publicly-accessibly digital archives have harmonized with interest among researchers to conjure a nascent field of study focused on the derivation and analysis of structured geographic data from books, letters, paintings, and much more. This semester, we will explore this field of *geospatial humanities*, learning its techniques, studying its objects, and testing its limits. The course introduces geospatial theory, methods, and technology for applications in the humanities in past and present settings. We'll sometimes use the term "GIS" (short for **geographic information systems**) to describe these geospatial tools. Typically, GIS is defined as a combination of software, data, methods, and hardware with capabilities for manipulating, analyzing, and displaying spatial data. We'll explore spatial data structures, data creation, basic geodesy, spatial analysis, cartographic visualization, and more. Using the software ArcGIS Pro, you will learn how to use these tools effectively. Just as importantly, by incorporating insights from critical archival studies, indigenous and decolonial mapping, feminist geography, and more into your mapping practice, you will learn how to use them *intentionally*.

# Learning objectives & practical skills

## Learning objectives

Students will learn to use GIS to answer humanistically-informed spatial questions. Detailed labs apply concepts presented in the lectures using a variety of geospatial software in the ArcGIS ecosystem (as well as basic data wrangling literacy in tools like Microsoft Excel). Assignments concentrate on creative applications of concepts covered in lectures and exercises, including a final project in which students independently explore a topic from their own field of interest.

Major learning objectives include:

- The coherence (or not) of geospatial humanities as a field
- Maps, mapping, and cartography as power-laden processes
- Methods and best practices for interacting with (digital) archives
- Spatial data structures, georeferencing, and geoprocessing
- "x" GIS, including critical, queer, decolonial, feminist, and anti-racist approaches to digital maps & mapping
- Technical skills for problem solving in the context of spatial data
- Approaches and applications of GIS across the humanities
- Basic concepts in spatial databases and queries
- Principles of cartographic design (and when to deviate from them)
- The limits of representation and analysis in GIS
- The limits of GIS itself

## Practical skills

More concretely, by the end of this course, students will be able to do the following:

- Identify data structures in spatial data (rasters or vectors)
- Identify, locate, and acquire spatial data pertinent to projects in their field of interest, as well as pinpoint significant gaps in or problems with existing information
- Evaluate the appropriateness of the existing data sources for use in a given application
- Evaluate spatial (meta)data as simultaneously effects and producers of particular kinds of power geometry
- Understand the data creation process and create historical spatial data sets derived from maps, gazetteers, aerial photography, texts, etc.
- Create spatial data from tabular or textual information that includes a spatial reference
- Describe, design, and use basic spatial databases such as the ArcGIS Pro Catalog (using keys, joins and queries)
- Use appropriate spatial analysis methods for raster and vector data, both independently and combined
- Create high-quality maps and associated graphics/visualizations with text that clearly communicate spatial information and the results of analysis
- Design an independent project that incorporates spatial analysis methods
- Appraise spatial analysis in journal articles
- Evaluate and select appropriate map projection and coordinate system
- Use ArcGIS Pro software with strong proficiency

# Grading

Grading will be based on a **1000-point scale**. You can submit graded activities, labs, assignments up to one week late. By default, all late work will receive a 10% deduction. Details regarding all course assignments, including requirements for the final project and instructions for curations, will be made available on Canvas.

-  Several **labs** (4 graded) worth a total of 250 points (50 each)
-  4 skill-building **assignments** worth a total of 400 points (100 each)
-  Class participation worth 100 points, including in-class and take-home **activities**
-  The **final project** poster or StoryMap worth 250 points
-  A **curatorial introduction** on a digital geohumanities project, process, or product, worth 100 points and presented in small groups

# Course Details

Beyond just showing up to class and paying attention during the lectures, students will develop a geospatial humanities skill set by completing various [activities](#activities), [exercises](#exercises), and [labs](#labs), including a [group curation](#curation). This skill set culminates in a [final project](#final-project) on a topic of their choosing.

## Activities

Nearly every week, we will spend time during class on some kind of **activity**. Some are bigger and some are smaller. Some are submitted and some are not. Overall, they count towards your participation grade.

## Labs

Throughout the semester, students will be assigned five **labs** which explore theories, concepts, and approaches in greater depth. I will drop your lowest Exercise grade at the end of the semester. Each lab weaves together methods and concepts, using them in a software application (usually ArcGIS Pro), and application to a particular area of the humanities.

## Assignments

**Assignments** concentrate on self-directed application of concepts explored in lectures and exercises. Eventually, you will use labs to focus on how geospatial humanities intersect with your own interests, building toward a final project that applies geospatial humanities methods to a topic of your choosing.

## Curation

Before the end of the semester, you and 2-3 peers will work together on a **curation** – a deep dive into a geospatial humanities project, process, or product – presenting your findings to the class in roughly 10 minutes. Instructions forthcoming.

## Final Project

Beginning in Week 8, you will begin work towards a final project. The final project is an opportunity to collect, process, analyze, and visualize spatial data of your own choosing. Using ArcGIS Pro, you'll choose a topic and elaborate it in three registers: its *conceptual register*, its *technical register*, and its *graphical register*. The final product will result in a **large-format infographic (poster) or an online interactive StoryMap** that describes the research question, data, and methods as well as the analysis and the results. Examples of similar student projects can be found at [Tufts GIS Expo Explorer](https:•expoexplorer.it.tufts.edu/).

Students may choose to exhibit their work at Tufts' GIS Expo day on May 8 for 25 points (2.5% of overall grade) of extra credit.

# Required Readings

You'll have something to read just about every week: this is, after all, a "humanities" course just as well as a "geospatial" one. All readings are  listed in the [schedule](#schedule), and they are available through online journal databases open to Tufts students, public web sites, or Canvas.

# Style Guidelines & Citation

All **cartographic work** should adhere, when appropriate, to key principles of map design.

All **written work** should be consistent with the style guidelines of one of the [major style guides](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/citation/styles). I have no preference for which one you choose – Chicago, MLA, and APA are all fine – but whatever you select must be applied consistently in your work.

To manage your readings and notes, I recommend downloading [Zotero](https://zotero.org). It is a free, highly customizable software that allows you to take notes, produce standardized bibliographies, and store readings in a single interface. Tufts provides a [guide](https://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/zotero) for getting started. Zotero will make your life easier far beyond this class, and the earlier you start using it, the better.

By week 4 of the course, if you have...

* Installed [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/)
* Installed the [Zotero Connector plugin](https://molloy.libguides.com/zotero/connector)
* Registered for a Zotero account through Tufts
* Loaded some of our course readings into Zotero

... I will give you 10 points (1% of your overall grade).

# Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Tufts University values the diversity of our body of students, staff, and faculty and recognizes the important contribution each student makes to our unique community. Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the Tufts experience. If a student has a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, they should please contact the StAAR Center (formerly Student Accessibility Services) at StaarCenter@tufts.edu or 617-627-4539 to make an appointment with an accessibility representative to determine appropriate accommodations. Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.

# Schedule

Our semester breaks down into three "Parts." During **[Part I](#part-i-fundamentals)** (weeks 1-4), we'll pick up the fundamentals of geospatial humanities. During **[Part II](#part-ii-approaches)** (weeks 5-9), the rubber meets the road as we experiment with various technical and analytical approaches to "doing" the geospatial humanities. During **[Part III](#part-iii-applications)** (weeks 10-15), we pivot towards applying these approaches to specific areas of study, including your own. Both the schedule and its weekly themes are subject to change.

 While this is not imperative, I recommend trying, to the extent that you are able, to complete course assignments **in the order that they are listed under the "Due before class" bullet**.
